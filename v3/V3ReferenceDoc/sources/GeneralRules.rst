General Rules
=============


*Naming Rules*

1. Defining identifiers in AADL must not be one of the reserved words of
   the language (see Section 0).

2. AADL is case insensitive. Identifiers and reserved words can be in upper or lower case
   (or a mixture of the two) (see Section 15).

   
   
NOTE: The **properties** subclause of the package is optional, or
requires an explicit empty subclause declaration. The latter is provided
to accommodate AADL modeling guidelines that require explicit
documentation of empty subclauses. An empty subclause declaration
consists of the reserved word of the subclause and a none statement (
**none ;** ).


The **features**, **flows**, **modes**, **annex**, and
**properties** subclauses of the component type are optional, or require
an explicit empty subclause declaration. The latter is provided to
accommodate AADL modeling guidelines that require explicit documentation
of empty subclauses. An empty subclause declaration consists of the
reserved word of the subclause and a none statement ( **none ;** ).
