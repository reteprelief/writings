General AADL Concepts
=====================

Naming Rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. AADL is a case sensitive language. 

#. Identifiers consist of upper case and lower case letters, digits, and the underscore character. The first identifier character must be a letter.

#. All keywords must be lower case.

#. Identifiers must not be one of the keywords.

#4. AADL supports name spaces. Defining identifiers/names must be unique within a name space.
