Features and Shared Access
==========================


A feature represents an interaction point of a component that is visible to
other components. Connections between features of different components represent exchange of control and data. 
Features include ports to support directional flow of data and control, shared data access, and remote procedure call interactions. Features also represent binding points between components in an application system and components in the hardware platform. 
Features also represent access to buses for modeling hardware interconnections via buses.

Features of a component are interaction points with other
components, i.e., ports and feature groups; subprogram parameters;
data component access, subprogram access, and bus access. Ports
represent directional flow of data and events between components,
feature groups represent groups of features that are connected to
another component, data component access represents access to
shared data components, subprogram access represents access to a
subprogram by a caller, and bus access represents access to a bus
from processor, memory, device, and other bus components to
establish hardware connectivity. Features are further described in
Section 8.


 A *feature* is a part of a component type definition that specifies
how that component interfaces with other components in the system.

 *Feature groups* represent groups of component features. Feature
groups can contain feature groups. Feature groups can be used
anywhere features can be used. Within a component, the features of a
feature group can be connected to individually. Outside a component,
feature groups can be connected as a single unit. Feature groups can
be partially defined without specifying the elements to play the
role of an abstract feature. It can later be refined into a group of
one or more features.

*Port* features represent a communication interface for the exchange
of data and events between components. Ports are classified into
data ports, event ports, and event data ports.

 *Subprogram access* features represent access to a subprogram to be
called from other components, and the need for a component to call a
subprogram instance locally, i.e., a subprogram that is declared in
the containing process or one of its subcomponents, or to call a
subprogram remotely, i.e., a subprogram instance in another process.
When used in data components subprogram access features represent
subprograms (methods) through which the data component is
manipulated. When used in subprogram groups subprogram access
features represent the subprograms of a subprogram library.

 *Subprogram group access* features represent sharing and required
access to a subprogram library.

(5) *Parameter* features represent data values that can be passed into
and out of subprograms. Parameters are typed with a data classifier
reference.

(6) *Data access* represents communication via shared access to data
components. A data component declared inside a component
implementation is specified to be accessible to components outside
using a provides access feature declaration. A component may
indicate that it requires access to a data subcomponent declared
outside utilizing a requires access feature declaration.

(7) *Bus access* represents physical connectivity of processors, memory,
devices, and buses through buses. A bus component declared inside a
component implementation is specified to be accessible to components
outside using a provides access feature declaration. A component may
indicate that it requires access to a bus utilizing a requires
access feature declaration.

(8) Features can be declared as one-dimensional feature arrays. Such
feature arrays complement component arrays and allow for connection
patterns that connect a feature of each of the component array
elements to a feature array element of one component. An example use
is redundant replicas of a component passing their output to a
voting component or a routing component.

Naming Rules

1. The defining identifier of a feature must be unique within the
   namespace of the associated component type.

1. Thread features may not be declared using the predeclared ports names
   Complete or Error.

2. Each refining feature identifier that appears in a feature refinement
   declaration must also appear in a feature declaration of a component
   type being extended.

3. A feature is referenced in one of two ways. Within the component
   implementations for a component type, a feature declared in the type
   is named in the implementations by its identifier. Within component
   implementations that contain subcomponents with features, a
   subcomponent feature is named by the subcomponent identifier and the
   feature identifier separated by a . (dot).

4. The path of a contained property association for a feature must refer
   to an element of a feature group.

Legality Rules

1. Each feature can be refined at most once in the same type extension.

1. A feature refinement declaration of a feature and the original
   feature must both be declared as port, parameter, access feature,
   or feature group, or the original feature must be declared as
   abstract feature.

2. Feature arrays must only be declared for thread, device, processor,
   memory, system, and abstract.

3. If the feature refinement specifies an array dimension, then the
   feature being refined must have an array dimension.

4. If the refinement specifies an array dimension size, then the feature
   being refined must not have an array dimension size.

5. A contained property association must only be used when the feature
   is a feature group.

6. In the case of a feature with a classifier reference, the classifier
   of the refined feature declaration in a component type extension
   must adhere to the classifier refinement rules as indicated by
   the Classifier\_Substitution\_Rule property (see Section 4.5). By
   default, the Classifier\_Match rule applies, i.e., an incomplete
   classifier reference can be completed.

Standard Properties

Acceptable Array Size: **list of** Size Range

Required Connection Quality Of Service : **inherit list of** Supported
Connection\_QoS

Required Virtual Bus Class : **inherit list of** **classifier** (virtual
bus)

Semantics

 A feature declaration specifies an interaction point with other
components. Features can be connected to features of other
components external to the component, and they can also be connected
to subcomponents within component implementations associated with
the component type with the feature declaration.

A refined feature declaration may complete an incomplete component
classifier reference and declare feature property associations. A
feature refinement may replace a classifier reference according to
the Classifier\_Substitution\_Rule property.

 Features can be declared with an array dimension, if the component
is a thread, data, device, memory, bus,or processor. In this case,
each element of the feature array is connected to a different
element of an ultimate source or destination component array.
Feature refinement declarations can complete the array dimension
with a size specification, but it cannot change the size. The array
dimension and size is inherited by the refined feature, if it is not
explicitly declared.

 For example, we may have a voting component that takes input from
multiple instances of the same processing component, as shown in
Figure 11. We can declare the processing component as an array of
subcomponents, and the single instance of the voting component with
a port array. We can then declare a connection from the outgoing
port of the processing subcomponent to the port of the voting
component declared with array dimensions. The connection can have a
Connection\_Pattern property of One\_To\_One (see Section 9.2.3) to
indicate that each processing component output is connected to a
separate port of the voting component. This is illustrated in the
example below.

Figure âˆ’ Port Array in a Voting Pattern
   

 A feature may specify desired quality of service or a particular
protocol to be used for connections through the feature. This
property must be consistent with the same property associated with
the connection.

1. .. rubric:: Abstract Features
  :name: abstract-features

 Abstract features represent generic features in conceptual and
physical system models. They can also be used as placeholders for
concrete features, i.e., ports, parameters, and the different kinds
of access features.

Syntax

abstract\_feature\_spec ::=

*defining\_abstract\_feature\_*\ identifier :

\| ( [ **in** \| **out** ] **prototype**
*feature\_prototype*\ \_identifier )

\| port\_refinement \| feature\_group\_refinement

\| subcomponent\_access\_refinement \| parameter\_refinement

Legality Rules

1. The feature direction in a refined feature declaration must be
   identical to the feature direction in the feature declaration
   being refined, or the feature being refined must not have a
   direction.

2. If the direction of an abstract feature is specified, then the
   direction must be satisfied by the refinement (see also the rules
   for feature prototypes in Section 4.7); in the case of ports the
   direction must be **in** or **out**; in the case of data access,
   the access right must be read-only for **in** and write-only for
   **out**; in the case of bus access, subprogram access and
   subprogram group access the direction must not be **in** nor
   **out**.

1. An abstract feature with a feature prototype identifier and the
   prototype being referenced must both specify the same direction
   or no direction.

2. An abstract feature refinement declaration of a feature with a
   feature prototype reference must only add property associations.

3. The unique component classifier reference of an abstract feature
   declaration must be to an abstract, data, bus, virtual bus,
   subprogram, subprogram group component classifier.

4. Abstract feature declarations with data component classifier
   reference must only be refined absto tract features, or concrete
   features with a data component classifier reference, i.e., data
   ports, event data ports, or data access features.

5. Abstract feature declarations with bus, virtual bus, subprogram, or
   subprogram group component classifier reference must only be
   refined to abstract features, or concrete features with the
   respective component classifier reference, e.g., bus access for
   bus classifiers.

Semantics

 A component type can contain an abstract feature declaration. An
abstract feature may be specified with a direction; this direction
must be satisfied by any refinement according to legality rules. An
abstract reature may represent a generic feature in a conceptual or
physical system model. An abstract feature may later be refined into
a feature group, port feature, access feature, or parameter.

A component type can contain an abstract feature declaration with a
feature prototype reference. In that case it is a placeholder for
the feature that acts as a parameter to the component type. The
actual feature will be supplied as part of the prototype binding
when the component type is referenced, e.g., in a subcomponent
declaration.

1. .. rubric:: Feature Groups and Feature Group Types
  :name: feature-groups-and-feature-group-types

 Feature groups represent groups of component features or feature
groups. Within a component, the features of a feature group can be
connected to individually. Outside a component, feature groups can
be connected as a single unit. This grouping concept allows the
number of connection declarations to be reduced, especially at
higher levels of a system when a number of features from one
subcomponent and its contained subcomponents must be connected to
features in another subcomponent and its contained subcomponents.
The content of a feature group is declared through a feature group
type declaration. This declaration is then referenced when feature
groups are declared as component features. Feature groups can be
declared for any kind of feature, for ports, and for access
features.

( unique\_feature\_group\_type\_reference \|
*feature\_group\_prototype\_*\ identifier ) ]

unique\_feature\_group\_type\_reference ::=

[ package\_name **::** ] *feature\_group\_type*\ \_identifier

Naming Rules

1. The defining identifier of a feature group type must be unique within
   the package namespace of the package where the feature group type is
   declared.

1. Each feature group type provides a local namespace. The defining
   identifiers of prototype, feature, and feature group declarations in
   a feature group type must be unique within the namespace of the
   feature group type.

2. The local namespace of a feature group type extension includes the
   defining identifiers in the local namespace of the feature group type
   being extended. This means, the defining identifiers of prototype,
   feature, or feature group declarations in a feature group type
   extension must not exist in the local namespace of the feature group
   type being extended. The defining identifiers of prototype, feature,
   or feature group refinements in a feature group type extension must
   refer to a prototype, feature, or feature group in the local
   namespace of an ancestor feature group type.

3. The defining feature identifiers of feature group declarations must
   be unique in the local name space of the component type containing
   the feature group declaration.

4. The defining feature group identifier of feature\_refinement
   declarations in component types must exist in the local namespace of
   the component type being extended and must refer to a feature or
   feature group.

5. The package name of the unique feature group type reference must
   refer to a package name in the global namespace. The feature group
   type identifier of the unique feature group type reference must refer
   to a feature group type identifier in the named package.

6. The prototype reference in a feature group declaration must refer to
   a prototype of the component type or feature group type that contains
   the feature group declaration.

Legality Rules

1. A feature group type may contain zero or more elements, i.e., feature
   or feature groups. If it contains zero elements, then the feature
   group type may be declared to be the inverse of another feature
   group type.

1. A feature group type can be declared to be the inverse of another
   feature group type, as indicated by the reserved words **inverse
   of** and the name of a feature group type. Any feature group type
   named in an **inverse of** statement cannot itself contain an
   **inverse of** statement. This means that several feature groups
   can be declared to be the inverse of one feature group, e.g., B
   inverse of A and C inverse of A is acceptable. However, chaining
   of inverses is not permitted, e.g., B inverse of A and C inverse
   of B is not acceptable.

2. Only feature group types without **inverse of** or feature group
   types with features and **inverse of** can be extended.

3. A feature group type that is an extension of another feature group
   type without an **inverse of** cannot contain an **inverse of**
   statement.

4. The feature group type that is an extension of another feature group
   type with features and **inverse of** that adds features must
   have an **inverse of** to identify the feature group type whose
   inverse it is.

5. A feature group declaration with an **inverse of** statement must
   only reference feature group types without an **inverse of**
   statement.

6. A feature group refinement may be refined to only add property
   associations. In this case inclusion of the feature group type
   reference is optional.

Two feature group types are considered to complement each other if the
following holds:

1. The number of feature or feature groups contained in the feature
   group and its complement must be identical;

2. Each of the declared features or feature groups in a feature group
   must be a pair-wise complement with that in the feature group
   complement, with pairs determined by declaration order. In the
   case of feature group type extensions, the feature and feature
   group declarations in the extension are considered to be declared
   after the declarations in the feature group type being extended;

3. If both feature group types have zero features, then they are
   considered to complement each other;

4. Ports are pair-wise complementary if they satisfy the port connection
   rules specified in Section 9.2.1. This includes appropriate port
   direction and matching of data component classifier references
   according to classifier matching rules (see Section 9.5 legality
   rules (L3) and (L4);

5. Access features are pair-wise complementary if they satisfy the
   access connection rules in Section 9.4.

6. If an **in** or **out** direction is specified as part of a feature
   group declaration, then all features inside the feature group
   must satisfy this direction.

NOTE: Aggregate data ports can be modeled in AADL V2 by a data port with
a data component classifier that has data subcomponents for each of the
element ports. This replaces the Aggregate\_Data\_Port on port groups in
the original AADL standard.

Semantics

 A feature group declaration represents groups of component features.
As such each feature group of a component type can represent a
separate interface to the component.

A feature group of a component can be connected to another component
through a single connection declaration. It represents a connection
for each of the feature inside the feature group. Feature groups can
contain feature groups. This supports nested grouping of features
for different levels of the modeled system.

 Within a component, the features of a feature group can be connected
to individually to subcomponents. The members of the feature group
are declared in a feature group type declaration that is referenced
by the feature group declaration. The referenced feature group type
determines the feature group compatibility for a feature group
connection.

 The **inverse of** reserved words of a feature group type
declaration indicate that the feature group type represents the
complement to the referenced feature group type. The legality of
feature group connections is affected by the complementary nature of
feature groups (see Section 9.5).

(5) Features can be declared without feature group types or with feature
group types without features. They are considered to be incomplete
feature group specifications. Feature group types can later be added
in a feature group refinement. Features can later be inserted
directly into the feature group type or the feature group type can
later be refined into feature group types with one or more features.

Ports
-----

 Ports are logical connection points between components that can be
used for the transfer of control and data between threads or between
a thread and a processor or device. Ports are directional, i.e., an
output port is connected to an input port. Ports can pass data,
events, or both. Data transferred through ports is typed. From the
perspective of the application source text, data ports are
accessible in the source text as data variables. From the
perspective of the application source text, event ports represent
event queues whose size is accessible. Incoming events may trigger
thread dispatches or mode transitions, or they may simply be queued
for processing by the recipient. From the perspective of the
application source text, event data ports represent message queues
whose content can be retrieved.

The content of incoming ports are frozen at a specified time, by
default at dispatch time. This means that the content of the port
that is accessible to the recipient does not change during the
execution of a dispatch even though the sender may send new values.
Properties specify the input and output timing characteristics of
ports. Actual event and data transfer may be initiated by the
runtime system of the execution platform or by Send\_Output runtime
service calls in the application source text.

 AADL distinguishes between three port categories. *Event data ports*
are ports through which data is sent and received. The arrival of
data at the destination may trigger a dispatch or a mode switch. The
data may be queued if the destination component is busy. Event data
ports effectively represent message ports. *Data ports* are event
data ports with a queue size of one in which the newest arrival is
kept. By default arrival of data at data ports does not trigger a
dispatch. Data ports effectively represent unqueued ports that
communicate state information, such as signal streams that are
sampled and processed in control loops. *Event ports* are event data
ports with empty message content. Event ports effectively represent
discrete events in the physical environment, such as a button push,
in the computing platform, such as a clock interrupt, or a logical
discrete event, such as an alarm.

Naming Rules

1. A defining port identifier must adhere to the naming rules specified
   for all features (see Section 8).

1. The defining identifier of a port refinement declaration must also
   appear in a feature declaration of a component type being extended
   and must refer to a port or an abstract feature.

2. The unique component type identifier of the data classifier reference
   must be the name of a data component type. The data implementation
   identifier, if specified, must be the name of a data component
   implementation associated with the data component type.

3. The prototype identifier of a prototype reference, if specified, must
   exist in the namespace of the component type or feature group type
   that contains the feature declaration.

Legality Rules

1. Ports can be declared in subprogram, thread, thread group, process,
   system, processor, virtual processor, and device component types.

1. Data and event data ports may be incompletely defined by not
   specifying the data component classifier reference or data
   component implementation identifier of a data component
   classifier reference. The port definition can be completed using
   refinement.

2. Data, event, and event data ports may be refined by adding a property
   association. The data component classifier declared as part of
   the data or event data port declaration being refined does not
   need to be included in this refinement.

3. The port category of a port refinement must be the same as the
   category of the port being refined, or the port being refined
   must be an abstract feature.

4. The port direction of a port refinement must be the same as the
   direction of the feature being refined. If the feature being
   refined is an abstract feature without direction, then all port
   directions are acceptable.

Semantics

Port Categories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  A port specifies a logical connection point in the interface of a
 component through which incoming or outgoing data and events may be
 passed. Ports may be named in connection declarations. Ports that
 pass data are typed by naming a data component classifier
 reference.

 A data or event data port maps to a static variable in the source
 text that represents the data buffer or queue. By default the
 variable is accessible by the same name as the port name. A
 different name mapping can be specified with the Source\_Name and
 Source\_Text properties. The Allowed\_Memory\_Binding and
 Allowed\_Memory\_Binding\_Class properties indicate the memory (or
 device) hardware the port resources reside on.

  Event and event data ports may dispatch a port specific
 Compute\_Entrypoint. This permits threads with multiple event or
 event data ports to execute different source text sequences for
 events arriving at different event ports. If specified, the port
 specific Compute\_Execution\_Time and Compute\_Deadline takes
 precedence over those of the containing thread.

  Ports are directional. An **out** port represents output provided
 by the sender, and an **in** port represents input needed by the
 receiver. An **in out** port represents both an **in** port and an
 **out** port. Incoming connection(s) and outgoing connection(s) of
 an **in out** port may be connected to the same component or to
 different components. For a data port, the **in out** port maps to
 a port variable in the source text. This means that the source text
 will overwrite the existing incoming value of the port when writing
 the output value to the port variable. The queues of incoming event
 data ports and event ports may require a port variable that holds
 the queue content that is frozen during the execution of a thread.
 In the case of event data ports, the outgoing data in the
 implementation may utilize a separate port variable.

(5)  Ports that provide output, i.e., **out** ports or **in out** ports,
 are referred to as outgoing port. Ports that provide input, i.e.,
 **in** ports or **in out** ports, are referred to as incoming
 ports.

(6)  A port can require a connection or consider it as optional as
 indicated by the Required\_Connection property. In the latter case
 it is assumed that the component with this port can function
 without the port being connected.

(7)  Ports appear to the thread as input and output buffers, accessible
 in source text as port variables.

(8)  Data and event data ports are used to transmit data between
 threads.

(9)  Data ports are intended for transmission of state data such as
 sensor data streams. Therefore, no queuing is supported for data
 ports. A thread can determine whether the input buffer of an in
 data port has new data at this dispatch by checking the port status
 through a Get\_Count service call, which is accessible through the
 port variable through a Get\_Value service call. If no new data
 value has been received the old value is made available.

(10) Event data ports are intended for message transmission, i.e., the
 queuing of the event and associated data at the port of the
 receiving thread. A receiving thread can get access to one or more
 data element in the queue according to the Dequeue\_Protocol and
 Dequeued\_Items properties (see Section 8.3.3). The number of
 queued event data elements accessible to a thread can be determined
 through the port variable using the Get\_Count service call.
 Individual element of the queue can be retrieved via the port
 variable using the Get\_Value and Next\_Value service calls. If the
 queue is empty the most recent data value is available.

(11) Event ports are intended for event and alarm transmission, i.e.,
 the queuing of events at the port of the receiving thread, possibly
 resulting in a dispatch or mode transition. A receiving thread can
 get access to one or more events in the queue according to the
 Dequeue\_Protocol and the Dequeue\_Items property. The number of
 queued events accessible to a thread can be determined through the
 port variable by making a Get\_Count service call.

(12) The role of an aggregate data port is to make a collection of data
 from multiple outgoing data ports available in a time-consistent
 manner. Time consistency in this context means that if a set of
 periodic threads is dispatched at the same time to operate on data,
 then the recipients of their data see either all old values or all
 new values. This is accomplished by declaring a data port, whose
 data classifier has an implementation with data components
 corresponding to the data of the individual data ports. The
 functionality of an aggregate data port can be viewed as a thread
 whose only role is to collect the data values from several **in**
 data ports and make them available as an aggregate data record; on
 the receiving side an equivalent thread takes passes on the
 elements of the aggregate data record on to the respective **out**
 data ports of receiving threads. The function may be optimized by
 mapping the data ports of the individual threads into a data area
 representing the aggregate data port variable. This aggregate is
 then transferred as a single unit.

 1. .. rubric:: Port Input and Output Timing
   :name: port-input-and-output-timing

(13) Data, events, and event data arriving through incoming ports is
 made available to the receiving thread, processor, or device at a
 specified input time. For a data port the input that is available
 through a port variable is a data value, while for an event or
 event data port it can be one or more elements from the port queue
 according to a specified dequeuing protocol (see Section 8.3.3).
 From that point on any newly arriving data, event, or event data is
 not available to the receiving component until the next dispatch,
 i.e., the content of an incoming port that is accessible to the
 application code does not change while the thread completes its
 execution.

(14) By default, port input is frozen at dispatch time. For periodic
 threads or devices this means that input is sampled at fixed time
 intervals.

(15) The Input\_Time property can be used to explicitly specify an input
 time for ports. This can be done for all ports by specifying the
 property value for the thread, or it can be specified separately
 for each port.

(16) The following property values for Input\_Time are supported to
 specify the input time to be the dispatch time (Dispatch), any time
 during execution relative to the amount of execution time from the
 start (Start) or from the completion (Completion), and the fact
 that no input occurs (NoIO):

-  Dispatch\_Time: (the default value) input is frozen at dispatch time;
   the time reference is clock time t = 0.

-  Start, time range: input is frozen at a specified amount of execution
   time from the beginning of execution. The time is within the
   specified time range. The time range must have positive values.
   Start\ :sub:`low` â‰¤ c â‰¤ Start\ :sub:`high`.

-  Completion, time range: input is frozen at a specified amount of
   execution time relative to execution completion. The time is within
   the specified time range. A negative time range indicates execution
   time before completion. c\ :sub:`complete` + Completion\ :sub:`low` â‰¤
   c â‰¤ c\ :sub:`complete` + Completion\ :sub:`high`, where
   c\ :sub:`complete` represents the value of c at completion time.

-  NoIO: input is not frozen. In other words, the port is excluded from
   making new input available to the source program. This allows users
   to specify that a subset of ports to provide input. The property
   value can be mode specific, i.e., a port can be excluded in one mode
   and included in another mode.

 The Input\_Time property can have a list of values. In this case it
indicates that input is frozen multiple times for the execution of a
dispatch. If a thread has multiple input times specified, then the
content of an incoming port is frozen multiple times during a single
dispatch.

The input may be frozen at dispatch time (Input\_Time property value
of Dispatch) as part of the underlying runtime system, or it may be
frozen through a Receive\_Input service call in the source text
(Input\_Time property value of Start or Completion).

 The input of other ports that can trigger dispatch is not frozen.
Input of the remaining ports is frozen according to the specified
input time.

 If a dispatch condition is specified then the logic expression
determines the combination of event and event data ports that
trigger a dispatch, and whose input is frozen as part of the
dispatch. The input of other ports that can trigger dispatch is not
frozen. The input of other ports that can trigger dispatch is not
frozen. Input of the remaining ports is frozen according to the
specified input time.

(5) If an event port is associated with a component (including thread)
containing modes and mode transition, and the mode transition names
the event port, then the arrival of an event is a mode change
request and it is processed according to the mode switch semantics
(see Sections 12 and 13.6).

(6) By default, the output time, i.e., the time output is transmitted to
connected components, is the completion time for data ports. By
default, for event and event data ports the output time occurs
anytime during the execution through a Send\_Output service call.

(7) The Output\_Time property can be used to explicitly specify an
output time for ports. This can be done for all ports by specifying
the property value for the thread, or it can be specified separately
for each port.

(8) The following property values for Output\_Time are supported to
specify the output time to be the dispatch time (Dispatch), any time
during execution relative to the amount of execution time from the
start (Start) or from the completion (Completion) including at
completion time, the deadline (Deadline), and the fact that no input
occurs (NoIO):

-  Start, time range: output is transmitted at a specified amount of
   execution time relative to the beginning of execution. The time is
   within the specified time range. The time range must have positive
   values. Start\ :sub:`low` â‰¤ c â‰¤ Start\ :sub:`high`.

-  Completion, time range: output is transmitted at a specified amount
   of execution time relative to execution completion. The time is
   within the specified time range. A negative time range indicates
   execution time before completion. c\ :sub:`complete` +
   Completion\ :sub:`low` â‰¤ c â‰¤ c\ :sub:`complete` +
   Completion\ :sub:`high`, where c\ :sub:`complete` repesents the value
   of c at completion time. The default is completion time with a time
   range of zero, i.e., it occurs at c = c\ :sub:`complete`.

-  Deadline: output is transmitted at deadline time; the time reference
   is clock time rather than execution time. t = Deadline. This allows
   for static alignment of output time of one thread with the
   Dispatch\_Time input time of another thread with a Dispatch\_Offset.

-  NoIO: output is not transmitted. In other words, the port is excluded
   from transmitting new output from the source text. This allows users
   to specify that a subset of ports to provide output. The property
   value can be mode specific, i.e., a port can be excluded in one mode
   and included in another mode.

 The Output\_Time property can have a list of values. In this case it
indicates that output is transmitted multiple times as part of the
execution of a dispatch.

The output may be transmitted at completion time or deadline as part
of the underlying runtime system, or it may be transmitted through a
Send\_Output service call in the source text.

 If the output time of the originating port is Completion\_Time while
the input time of the receiving port is Dispatch and the sender and
receiver are in the same synchronization domain, then the output is
received at the next dispatch equal to or later than the deadline.
To accommodate the transfer the actual transfer may be initiated
before the deadline. In the case of the connection crossing
synchronization domains, the input is received at the dispatch
following the completion of the transfer.

 The Input\_Rate and Output\_Rate properties specify the number of
times per dispatch (perDispatch) or per second (perSecond) at which
input and output is expected to occur at the port with the
associated property. By default the input and output rate of ports
is once per dispatch. The rate can be fixed or according to a
distribution.

(5) An input or output rate higher than once per dispatch indicates that
multiple inputs or multiple outputs are expected during a single
dispatch. An input or output rate lower than once per dispatch
indicates that inputs or outputs are not expected at every dispatch.

(6) If an Input\_Time or Output\_Time property is specified, then the
values must be consistent with the rate. If the rate is specified in
terms of seconds and a period is specified for the thread or device
with the port, then the period value must also be consistent with
the other values. In the case of an Input\_Time or Output\_Time
property value of NoIO the rate value does not apply.

-- a thread that gets input partway into execution and sends output

-- before completion.

{Output\_Time => ((Time=>Completion;Offset=>10 us .. 11 us;));}Â ;

**end** TightLoop;

Port Queue Processing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Event and event data ports can have a queue associated with them. By
default, the incoming event ports and event data ports of threads,
devices, and processors have queues. The output from the ultimate
source of a semantic port connection is added into this queue, if
the ultimate destination component is actively processing. The
default port queue size is 1 and can be changed by explicitly
declaring a Queue\_Size property association for the port.

The Queue\_Size, Queue\_Processing\_Protocol, and
Overflow\_Handling\_Protocol port properties specify queue
characteristics. If an event arrives and the number of queued events
(and any associated data) is equal to the specified queue size, then
the Overflow\_Handling\_Protocol property determines the action. If
the Overflow\_Handling\_Protocol property value is Error, then an
error occurs for the thread. The thread can determine the port that
caused the error by calling the standard Dispatch\_Status runtime
service. For Overflow\_Handling\_Protocol property values of
DropNewest and DropOldest, the newly arrived or oldest event in the
queue event is dropped.

 Queues will be serviced according to the
Queue\_Processing\_Protocol, by default in a first-in, first-out
order (FIFO). When an aperiodic, sporadic, timed, or hybrid thread
declares multiple in event and event data ports in its type that can
be dispatch triggers and more than one of these queues are nonempty,
the port with the higher Urgency property value gets serviced first.
If several ports with the same Urgency are non-empty, then the
Queue\_Processing\_Protocol is applied across these ports and must
be the same for them. In the case of FIFO the oldest event will be
serviced (global FIFO). It is permitted to define and use other
algorithms for picking among multiple non-empty queues. Disciplines
other than FIFO may be used for managing each individual queue.

 By default, one item is dequeued and made available to the receiving
application through the port variable. The Dequeue\_Protocol
property specifies different dequeuing options.

-  OneItem: (default) a single frozen item is dequeued and made
   available to the source text unless the queue is empty. The
   Next\_Value service call has no effect.

-  AllItems: all items that are frozen at input time are dequeued and
   made available to the source text via the port variable, unless the
   queue is empty. Individual items become accessible as port variable
   value through the Next\_Value service call.

-  MultipleItems: multiple items can be dequeued one at a time from the
   frozen queue and made available to the source text via the port
   variable. One item is dequeued and its value made available via the
   port variable with each Next\_Value service call. Any items not
   dequeued remain in the queue and are available for the next dispatch.

 The Get\_Count service call indicates how many items have been made
available to the source text. A value of zero indicates that no new
item is available via a data port, event port, or event port
variable. A value greater than zero indicates that one or more fresh
values are available.

A port may have a Fan\_Out\_Policy property. This property indicates
how the content is transferred through outgoing connections. The
content can be passed to all recipients (Broadcast), or the output
is distributed evenly to the recipients (RoundRobin), to one
recipient based on content/routing information (Selective), or to
the next recipient ready to be dispatched (OnDemand). Broadcast,
RoundRobin, and Selective pass on data and events without queuing
it, while OnDemand requires a queue that is serviced by the
recipients. The size of the queue and other queue characteristics
are specified as properties of the port with the fan-out.

 An event or event data port with a fan-out policy of OnDemand allows
us to model a queue being serviced by multiple recipients. For
example, a queue on an incoming thread group port that is connected
to multiple threads allows sender output to be queued in a single
queue and be serviced by multiple threads (see also Section 9.2.6).

1. .. rubric:: Events and Subprograms
  :name: events-and-subprograms

 Any subprogram, thread, device, or processor with an outgoing event
port, i.e., **out event**, **out event data**, **in out event**,
**in out event data**, can be the source of an event. During a
single dispatch execution, a thread may raise zero or more events
and transmit zero or more event data through Send\_Output runtime
service calls. It may also raise an event at completion through its
reserved Complete port (see Section 5.4) and transmit event data
through event data ports that contain new values that have not been
transmitted through explicit Send\_Output runtime service calls.

(5) Events are received through **in event**, **in out event**, **in
event data**, and **in out event data** ports, i.e., incoming ports.
If such an incoming port is associated with a thread and the thread
does not contain a mode transition naming the port, then the event
or event data arriving at this port is added to the queue of the
port. If the thread is aperiodic or sporadic and does not have its
Dispatch event connected, then each event and event data arriving
and queued at any incoming ports of the thread results in a separate
request for thread dispatch.

Runtime Support For Ports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 The application program interface for the following services is
defined in the applicable source language annex of this standard.
They are callable from within the source text.

A Send\_Output runtime service allows the source text of a thread to
explicitly cause events, event data, or data to be transmitted
through outgoing ports to receiver ports. The Send\_Output service
takes a port list parameter that specifies for which ports the
transmission is initiated. The send on all ports is considered to
occur logically simultaneously. Send\_Output is a non-blocking
service. An exception is raised if the send fails with exception
codes indicating the failing port and type of failure.

**subprogram** Send\_Output

**features**

OutputPorts: **in parameter** <implementation-dependent port list>;

-- List of ports whose output is transferred

SendException: **out event data**; -- exception if send fails to
complete

**end** Send\_Output;

NOTE: The Send\_Output runtime service replaces the Raise\_Event service
in the original AADL standard\ *. *

 A Put\_Value runtime service allows the source text of a thread to
supply a data value to a port variable. This data value will be
transmitted at the next Send\_Output call in the source text or by
the runtime system at completion time or deadline.

**subprogram** Put\_Value

**features**

Portvariable: **requires data access**; -- reference to port variable

DataValue: **in parameter**; -- value to be stored

DataSize: **in parameter**; - size in bytes (optional)

**end** Put\_Value;

 A Receive\_Input runtime service allows the source text of a thread
to explicitly request port input on its incoming ports to be frozen
and made accessible through the port variables. Any previous content
of the port variable is overwritten, i.e., any previous queue
content not processed by Next\_Value calls is discarded. The
Receive\_Input service takes a parameter that specifies for which
ports the input is frozen. Newly arriving data may be queued, but
does not affect the input that thread has access to (see Section
9.1). Receive\_Input is a non-blocking service.

**subprogram** Receive\_Input

**features**

InputPorts: **in parameter** <implementation-dependent port list>;

-- List of ports whose input is frozen

**end** Receive\_Input;

 In the case of data ports the value is made available without
requiring a Next\_Value call. The Get\_Count will return the value 1
if the value has been updated, i.e., is *fresh*. If the data is not
fresh, the value zero is returned.

In the case of event data ports each data value is retrieved from
the queue through the Next\_Value call and made available as port
variable value. Subsequent calls to Get\_Value or direct access of
the port variable will return this value until the next Next\_Value
call.

 In case of event ports and event data ports the queue is available
to the thread, i.e., Get\_Count will return the size of the queue.
If the queue size is greater than one the Dequeued\_Items property
and Dequeue\_Protocol property may specify that more than one
element is made accessible to the source text of a thread.

 A Get\_Value runtime service shall be provided that allows the
source text of a thread to access the current value of a port
variable. The service call returns the data value. Repeated calls to
Get\_Value result in the same value to be returned, unless the
current value is updated through a Receive\_Input call or a
Next\_Value call.

**subprogram** Get\_Value

**features**

Portvariable: **requires data access**; -- reference to port variable

DataValue: **out parameter**; -- value being retrieved

DataSize: **in parameter**; - size in bytes (optional)

**end** Get\_Value;

 A Get\_Count runtime service shall be provided that allows the
source text of a thread to determine whether a new data value is
available on a port variable, and in case of queued event and event
data ports, who many elements are available to the thread in the
queue. A count of zero indicates that no new data value is
available.

**subprogram** Get\_Count

**features**

Portvariable: **requires data access**; -- reference to port variable

CountValue: **out parameter** BaseTypes::Integer; -- content count of
port variable

**end** Get\_Count;

 A Next\_Value runtime service shall be provided that allows the
source text of a thread to get access to the next queued element of
a port variable as the current value. A NoValue exception is raised
if no more values are available.

**subprogram** Next\_Value

**features**

Portvariable: **requires data access**; -- reference to port variable

DataValue: **out parameter**; -- value being retrieved

DataSize: **in parameter**; -- size in bytes (optional)

NoValue: **out event port**; -- exception if no value is available

**end** Next\_Value;

 A Updated runtime service shall be provided that allows the source
text of a thread to determine whether input has been transmitted to
a port since the last Receive\_Input service call.

**subprogram** Updated

**features**

Portvariable: **in parameter** <implementation-dependent port
reference>;

-- reference to port variable

FreshFlag: **out parameter** BaseTypes::Boolean; -- true if new arrivals

**end** Updated;

Processing Requirements and Permissions

 For each data or event data port declared for a thread, a system
implementation method must provide sufficient buffer space within
the associated binary image to unmarshall the value of the data
type. Adequate buffer space must be allocated to store a queue of
the specified size for each event data port. The applicable source
language annex of this standard defines data variable declarations
that correspond to the data or event data features. Buffer variables
may be allocated statically as part of the source text data
declarations. Alternatively, buffer variables may be allocated
dynamically while the process is loading or during thread
initialization. A method of implementing systems may require the
data declarations to appear within source files that have been
specified in the source text property. In some implementations,
these declarations may be automatically generated for inclusion in
the final set of source text. A method of implementing systems may
allow direct visibility to the buffer variables. Runtime service
calls may be provided to access the buffer variables.

The type mark used in the source variable declaration must match the
type name of the port data component type. Language-specific annexes
to this standard may specify restrictions on the form of a source
variable declaration to facilitate verification of compliance with
this rule.

 For each event or event data port declared for a thread, a method of
implementing the system must provide a source name that can be used
to refer to that event within source text. The applicable source
language annex of this standard defines this name and defines the
source constructs used to declare this name within the associated
source text. A method of implementing systems may require such
declarations to appear within source files that have been specified
in the source text property. In some implementations, these
declarations may be automatically generated for inclusion in the
final set of source text.

 If any source text associated with a software component contains a
runtime service call that operates on an event, then the enumeration
value used in that service call must have a corresponding event
feature declared for that component.

(5) A method of processing specifications is permitted to use
non-standard property definitions and associations to define
alternative queuing disciplines.

(6) A method of implementing systems is permitted to optimize the number
of port variables necessary to perform the transmission of data
between ports as long as the semantics of such connections are
maintained. For example, the source text variable representing an
out data port and the source text variable representing the
connected in data port may be mapped to the same memory location
provided their execution lifespan does not overlap.

Subprogram and Subprogram Group Access
--------------------------------------

 Subprograms and subprogram groups can be made accessible to other
components. Components can declare that they require access to
subprograms and subprogram groups. Components may provide access to
their subprograms and subprogram groups. Subprogram access is used
to model binding of a subprogram call (local or remote) to the
subprogram instance being called.

Syntax

( **provides** \| **requires** ) **subprogram group** **access**

[ *subprogram\_group*\ \_unique\_component\_classifier\_reference

\| *subprogram\_group\_component\_prototype\_*\ identifier ]

Naming Rules

1. The defining identifier of a provides or requires subprogram or
   subprogram group access declaration must be unique within the
   namespace of the component type where the subcomponent access is
   declared.

1. The defining identifier of a provides or requires subprogram or
   subprogram group refinement must exist as a defining identifier of a
   provides or requires subprogram or subprogram group or an abstract
   feature in the namespace of the component type being extended.

2. The component type identifier or component implementation name of a
   subprogram or subprogram group access classifier reference, if
   present, must exist in the package namespace.

3. The prototype identifier of a subprogram or subprogram group access
   classifier reference, if present, must exist in the namespace of the
   classifier that contains the access declaration.

Legality Rules

1. If a subprogram access refers to a component classifier or a
   component prototype, then the category of the classifier or
   prototype must be **subprogram**.

1. If a subprogram group access refers to a component classifier or a
   component prototype, then the category of the classifier or
   prototype must be **subprogram group**.

2. An abstract feature can be refined into a subprogram access or a
   subprogram group access. In this case, the abstract feature must
   not have a direction specified.

3. A subprogram or subprogram group access declaration that does not
   specify a component classifier reference is incomplete. Such a
   reference can be added in a subprogram or subprogram group access
   refinement declaration.

4. A subprogram or subprogram group access declaration may be refined by
   adding a property association. Inclusion of the component
   classifier reference is optional.

5. A provides subprogram access cannot be refined to a requires
   subprogram access and a requires subprogram access cannot be
   refined to a provides subprogram access. Similarly, a provides
   subprogram group access cannot be refined to a requires
   subprogram group access and a requires subprogram group access
   cannot be refined to a provides subprogram group access.

Consistency Rules

1. A *provides subprogram access* feature indicates that a subprogram is
   made available to be referenced. A project may enforce a consistency
   rule that a subprogram access connection connects this feature to
   directly a subprogram subcomponent, or indirectly via a *requires
   subprogram (group) access* or *provides subprogram (group) access*.

Standard Properties

Subprogram Call Rate: Rate\_Spec => [ Value Range => 1.0 .. 1.0;
Rate\_Unit => PerDispatch; Rate Distribution => Fixed; ]

Overflow Handling\_Protocol: **enumeration** (DropOldest, DropNewest,

Urgency: **aadlinteger** 0 **..** Max Urgency

Semantics

 A *required subprogram (group) access* declaration indicates that a
component requires access to a externally declared subprogram
(group). Required subprogram (group) accesses are resolved to
subprogram (group) subcomponents through access connection
declarations.

A *provides subprogram (group) access* declaration indicates that a
component provides access to a subprogram (group) subcomponent
contained in the component. Provided subprogram (group) accesses can
be used to resolve required subprogram (group) accesses.

 A subprogram that is accessed by more than one component is shared
and must be reentrant. The shared subprogram may be called by
multiple threads. This may result in concurrent access to shared
data components.

 If a different thread provides access to a subprogram then the call
is remote, i.e., executed by the thread with the provides subprogram
access feature. Otherwise the call is a local call, i.e., executed
by the calling thread.

(5) In case of a remote subprogram call, the requesting thread calls a
local proxy that carries out the service request. The proxy may
marshall and unmarshall the parameters as necessary. The execution
time of the client proxy is determined by the
Client\_Subprogram\_Execution\_Time property. The actual call
results in communicating the subprogram execution request to the
remote thread. While the call is in progress, the calling thread is
blocked. Upon completion of the remote subprogram execution and
return of results, the calling thread resumes execution by entering
the ready state. A semi-synchronous remote call may be supported
where the calling thread may issue the call and wait for the result
at a later time by calling Await\_Result (see Section 5.4.8). In
this case the caller may issue multiple remote calls to be executed
concurrently.

(6) If the called subprogram raises events or event data and the
subprogram call is a remote call, then the raised event in the
subprogram is mapped to the corresponding event or event data port
of the caller subprogram proxy.

(7) Each provides subprogram access feature of a thread that represents
an entrypoint to a remotely callable code sequence in the source
text. A request for execution of such a subprogram is a dispatch
request to the thread containing the subprogram. Requests for
execution of subprograms may be queued if the thread is already
executing a dispatch request. A thread can have multiple subprogram
entrypoints, expressed by multiple subprogram access feature
declarations. Only one of these subprograms may be executed per
thread dispatch. Queuing and queue servicing follows the semantics
of event port queues.

(8) Execution of subprogram calls may get blocked for two reasons. A
call may get blocked if the call is remote to a thread that services
calls and it is currently executing a dispatch, or it may get
blocked because the called subprogram operates in a shared data
component. This is the case, if the called subprogram is a *provides
subprogram (group) access* feature of a data component that itself
has shared access, i.e., is an access method of a data object, or if
a shared data component is accessible to the subprogram through a
requires data access feature of the subprogram. In the former case
the thread servicing the calls assures mutual exclusion, while other
remote calls to subprograms of the thread are queued. In the latter
case, concurrent access to the data component is assured to be
mutually exclusive according to the Concurrency\_Control\_Protocol
property value and realized through the Get\_Resource service call
in the source text, while other mutually exclusive access attempts
to shared data components are queued.

(9) Call\_Rate specifies the number of times per dispatch or per second
at which a subprogram is called.

Subprogram Parameters
---------------------

 Subprogram parameter declarations represent data values that can be
passed into and out of subprograms. Parameters are typed with a data
classifier reference representing the data type.

Syntax

parameter\_spec ::=

*defining\_parameter*\ \_identifier :

( **in** \| **out** \| **in out** ) **parameter**

[ *data\_unique\_component\_classifier\_reference* \|

*data\_component\_prototype\_identifier* ]

parameter\_refinement ::=

*defining\_parameter*\ \_identifier : **refined to**

( **in** \| **out** \| **in out** ) **parameter**

[ *data\_unique\_component\_classifier\_reference* \|

*data\_component\_prototype\_*\ identifier ]

Naming Rules

1. The defining identifier of a parameter must be unique within the
   namespace of the subprogram type containing the parameter
   declaration.

1. The defining parameter identifier of a parameter refinement
   declaration must also appear in a feature declaration of a component
   type being extended and must refer to a parameter or an abstract
   feature.

2. The data classifier reference must refer to a data component type or
   a data component implementation.

3. The prototype identifier, if present, must exist in the namespace of
   the subprogram classifier that contains the parameter declaration.

Legality Rules

1. Parameters can be declared for subprogram component types.

1. A parameter declaration that does not specify a data classifier
   reference is incomplete. Such a reference can be added in a
   parameter refinement declaration.

2. A parameter declaration may be refined by adding a property
   association. Inclusion of the data classifier reference is
   optional.

3. The parameter direction of a parameter refinement must be the same as
   the direction of the feature being refined. If the feature being
   refined is an abstract feature without direction, then all
   parameter directions are acceptable.

Standard Properties

-- Properties specifying the source text representation of the parameter

Source Name: **aadlstring**

Source Text: **inherit list of aadlstring**

Semantics

 A subprogram parameter specifies the data that are passed into and
out of a subprogram. The data type specified for the parameter and
the data type of the actual data passed to a subprogram must be
compatible according to the Classifier\_Matching\_Rule.

An **in out** parameter declaration represents a parameter whose
value is passed in and returned by value. Parameters passed by
reference are modeled using **requires data access**.

1. .. rubric:: Data Component Access
  :name: data-component-access

 Data component access is used to model shared data. Data components
can be made accessible outside their containment hierarchy.
Components can declare that they require access to externally
declared data components. Components may provide access to their
data components.

 The use of component access for data components is illustrated in
Figure 12. Data2, Thread1, and Thread2 are subcomponents of a
process implementation. Thread1 contains a data subcomponent called
Data1. Data1 is made accessible outside Thread1 through a **provides
data access** feature declaration in the thread type of Thread1. It
is being accessed by Thread2 as expressed by a **requires data
access** feature declaration in the thread type of Thread2. Thread1
accesses data component Data2.

( **provides** \| **requires** ) **data** **access**

[ *data*\ \_unique\_component\_classifier\_reference

\| *prototype*\ \_identifier ]

Naming Rules

1. The defining identifier of a provides or requires data access
   declaration must be unique within the namespace of the component type
   where the data access is declared.

1. The defining identifier of a provides or requires data access
   refinement must exist as a defining identifier of a provides or
   requires data access or as a defining identifier of an abstract
   feature in the namespace of the component type being extended.

2. The component type identifier or component implementation name of a
   data access classifier reference must exist in the package namespace.

3. The prototype identifier, if present, must exist in the namespace of
   the classifier that contains the data access declaration.

Legality Rules

1. If a data access refers to a component classifier or a component
   prototype, then the category of the classifier or prototype must
   be of category **data**.

1. A data access declaration may be refined by refining the data
   classifier, by adding a property association, or by doing both.
   If the refinement only adds a property association the classifier
   reference is optional.

2. A provides data access cannot be refined to a requires data access
   and a requires data access cannot be refined to a provides data
   access.

3. An abstract feature can be refined into a data access. In this case,
   the abstract feature must not have a direction specified.

Consistency Rules

1. A data access declaration that does not specify a data classifier
   reference is incomplete. Such a reference can be added in a data
   access refinement declaration.

1. If the source code of a component does access shared data, then the
   component type declaration must specify a requires data access
   declaration. In other words, for all components that access shared
   data their component type declaration must reflect that fact.

2. A data access refinement may refine an abstract feature declaration.
   If the abstract feature declaration specifies a direction of **in**,
   then the access right of the data access must be read-only. If the
   direction is **out**, then the access right of the data access must
   be write-only. If the abstract feature does not have a specified
   direction, then any access right is acceptable.

Standard Properties

Access\_Right : Access\_Rights => read\_write

Reference\_Time: **inherit reference** (processor, device, bus, system,
abstract)

Access\_Time: **record** (

First: IO\_Time\_SpecÂ ;

Last: IO\_Time\_SpecÂ ; )

=> [ First =>[Time => Start; Offset => 0.0 ns .. 0.0 ns;];

Last => [Time => Completion; Offset => 0.0 ns .. 0.0 ns;];Â ]

Semantics

 A *requires data access* declaration in the component type indicates
that a component requires access to a component declared external to
the component. Required data accesses are resolved to actual data
subcomponents through access connection declarations. For data
components different forms of required access, such as read-only
access, are specified by a Access\_Right property. Read-only access
can also be specified through a directional access connection from
the data component to the *requires data access* feature, while
write-only access is specified through a directional access
connection to the data component.

A *provides data access* declaration in the component type indicates
that a subcomponent provides access to a data component contained in
the component. Provided data accesses can be used to resolve
required subcomponent access. For data and bus components different
forms of provided access, such as read-only access, are specified by
a Access\_Right property or be directional access connections.

 If a data access feature is a refinement of an abstract feature,
then the direction of the abstract feature, if specified, imposes a
restriction on the data flow, i.e., **in** implies read-only, and
**out** implies write-only.

 Shared data may be accessed by multiple threads. Such potential
concurrent access is controlled according to the
Concurrency\_Control\_Protocol property.

(5) Access\_Time specifies the time range over which a component has
access to a shared data component. By default access is required for
the duration of the component execution. The value of a shared data
component is read or written through the use of a data variable that
represents the shared data component, or through Get\_Value and
Put\_Value service calls. Write access immediately updates the
shared data component.

Bus Component Access
--------------------

 Bus components can be made accessible to other components.
Components can declare that they require access to externally
declared buses. Components may provide access to their buses. Bus
access is used to model connectivity of execution platform
components through buses.

 Figure 13 illustrates the use of a shared bus. Bus1 provides the
connection between Processor1, Memory1, and Device1. In addition,
the bus is being made accessible outside System1.

2. If a bus access feature is a refinement of an abstract feature, then
   the direction of the abstract feature, if specified, imposes a
   restriction on the access right, i.e., **in** implies read-only, and
   **out** implies write-only.

Standard Properties

Access\_Right : Access\_Rights => read\_write

Semantics

 A *required bus component access* declaration in the component type
indicates that a component requires access to a component declared
external to the component. Required bus accesses are resolved to
actual bus subcomponents through access connection declarations.

A *provides bus access* declaration in the component type indicates
that a subcomponent provides access to a bus contained in the
component. Provided bus accesses can be used to resolve required bus
access. For bus components different forms of provided access, such
as read-only access, are specified by a Access\_Right property or by
directional access connections.

 A bus that is accessed by more than one component is shared. The
shared bus is a common resource through which processor, memory, and
device components communicate.

1. .. rubric:: Internal Features and Processor Features
  :name: internal-features-and-processor-features

 Internal features and processor features allow users to explicitly
declare placeholders used in connection declarations whose endpoints
include the keyword **self** or **processor**.

(5) Internal features represent sources of events and event data that
are internal to the component. They are referenced in connections
prefixed with the keyword **self**.

(6) Processor features act as proxies for features in processors that a
software component is bound to. Processor features are referenced in
connection declarations that represents calls to processor API
subprograms or event flows from processor ports to application
software.

Syntax

internal\_feature ::=

defining\_internal\_feature\_identifier :

( **event** \|

**event data** [ data\_unique\_component\_classifier\_reference ]

)

processor\_feature ::=

defining\_processor\_feature\_identifier :

( **port** [ data\_unique\_component\_classifier\_reference ] )

\|

**subprogram** [ subprogram\_unique\_component\_classifier\_reference ]

)

Naming Rules

1. The defining identifier of an internal feature or processor feature
   declaration must be unique within the namespace of the component
   implementation where it is declared.

1. The qualified name of a data or subprogram classifier reference must
   exist in the package namespace.

Semantics

 An *internal feature* declaration in the component implementation
indicates a component internal event or data source, e.g., the
detection point of an error condition as specified in the Error
Model Annex. Connection declarations in the component implementation
may refer to internal features by prefixing the reference with the
keyword **self**.

A *processor feature* declaration in the component implementation
acts as proxy for features in a processor the component may be bound
to and have connection declarations that refer to the features as
endpoints â€“ prefixed with the keyword **processor**.

Connections 
============

 A *connection* is a linkage between features of two components that
represents communication of data and control between components.
This can be the transmission of control and data between ports of
different threads or between threads and processor or device
components. A connection may denote an event that triggers a mode
transition. The timing of data and control transmission depends on
the connection category and on the dispatch protocol of the
connected threads. The flow of data between parameters of subprogram
calls within a thread may be specified using connections. Finally,
connections designate access to shared components.

 The AADL supports connections between abstract features, feature
groups connections, port connections, parameter connections, and
access connections. Port connections represent directional flow of
data and control between two concurrently executing components,
i.e., between two threads or between a thread and a processor or
device. Parameter connections denote the flow of data through the
parameters of a sequence of subprogram calls within a thread. Data
access connections designate access to shared data components by
concurrently executing threads or by subprograms executing within a
thread. Bus access connections represent communication between
processors, memory, and devices by accessing a shared bus.
Subprogram access connections represent the binding of a subprogram
call to a subprogram instance being called.

When an AADL model with a thread architecture is instantiated, a
connection instance is created from the ultimate source to the
ultimate destination component by following a sequence of connection
declarations. The ultimate source and ultimate destination typically
are the active components in the instance model or components whose
access is shared. This connection instance is referred to as
semantic connection and its semantic details are defined for each of
the different types of connections. If the AADL model is not fully
detailed to the thread level, connection instances are created
between the leaf components in the system hierarchy.

Syntax

connection ::=

*defining\_connection\_*\ identifier **:**

\| parameter\_connection

\| access\_connection

\| parameter\_connection\_refinement

\| access\_connection\_refinement

\| feature\_group\_connection\_refinement )

[ **{** { property\_association }\ :sup:`+` **}** ]

[ in\_modes\_and\_transitions ] ;

Naming Rules

1. The defining identifier of a defined connection declaration must be
   unique in the local namespace of the component implementation with
   the connection subclause. This is also the case for mode-specific
   connection declarations, i.e., declarations with an
   in\_modes\_and\_transition subclause.

1. The connection identifier in a connection refinement declaration must
   refer to a named connection declared in an ancestor component
   implementation.

Legality Rules

1. A connection refinement must contain at least one of the following: a
   connection source and destination subclause, a property
   association, an **in modes** subclause.

1. If a semantic connection may be active in a particular mode, then the
   ultimate source and ultimate destination components must be part
   of that mode.

2. If a semantic connection may be active in a particular mode
   transition, then the ultimate source component must be part of a
   system mode that includes the old mode identifier and the
   ultimate destination component must be part of a system mode that
   includes the new mode identifier.

Semantics

 Connections define directional and bidirectional connectivity
between abstract features, ports, access features, parameters, and
between feature groups.

Connections can have properties. Connections can be defined to be
active in certain modes or in mode transitions, as indicated by the
in\_modes\_and\_transition subclause.

1. .. rubric:: Feature Connections
  :name: feature-connections

 A feature connection can be declared between two abstract features
of components. If the features specify a direction, then the source
of the connection is the feature with the **out** direction and the
destination is the feature with the **in** direction. Otherwise, the
connection is considered to be bidirectional.

 A feature connection can connect nested features, i.e., features
inside feature groups, when the connection connects two
subcomponents. This provides a way of connecting subcomponents with
feature groups, whose nesting hierarchies differ.

Syntax

feature\_connection ::=

**feature** *source*\ \_feature\_reference connection\_symbol

*destination*\ \_feature\_reference

connection\_symbol ::=

directional\_connection\_symbol \| bidirectional\_connection\_symbol

directional\_connection\_symbol ::= **->**

bidirectional\_connection\_symbol ::= **<->**

feature\_reference ::=

-- feature in the component type

*component\_type\_feature*\ \_identifier \|

-- feature in a feature group of the component type

*component\_type\_feature\_group*\ \_identifier **.**
*feature*\ \_identifier \|

-- feature in a subcomponent

{ **.** *nested\_feature\_*\ identifier }\*

-- feature in a call

*subprogram\_call*\ \_identifier **.** *feature*\ \_identifier

feature\_connection\_refinement ::=

**feature **

Naming Rules

1. A source or destination reference in a feature connection declaration
   must reference a feature declared in the component type, a feature in
   a feature group of the component type, or a feature of one of the
   subcomponents. The source and destination features must be abstract
   features, ports, parameters, access features, or feature groups.

1. The subcomponent reference may refer to a subcomponent or a
   subcomponent array.

Legality Rules

1. The feature identifier of a subcomponent reference may refer to a
   feature array, if the subcomponent is a thread, device, or processor.

The direction declared for the destination feature of a feature
connection declaration must be compatible with the direction declared
for the source feature as defined by the following rules:

1. If the feature connection declaration represents a connection between
   features of sibling components, then the source must be an
   outgoing feature and the destination must be an incoming feature.
   An *outgoing feature* is an abstract feature with no direction or
   **out** direction, an outgoing port or parameter with an **out**
   or **in out** direction, or an access feature, in the case of
   data access with at least write access. An *incoming feature* is
   an abstract feature with no direction or **in** direction, an
   incoming port or parameter with an **in** or **in out**
   direction, or an access feature, in the case of data access with
   at least read access.

2. If the feature connection declaration represents a connection between
   features up the containment hierarchy, then the source and
   destination must both be outgoing features.

3. If the feature connection declaration represents a connection between
   features down the containment hierarchy, then the source and
   destination must both be incoming features.

4. If the feature connection declaration specifies a directional
   connection, then the direction of the connection must be
   supported by the direction of the source and destination
   features.

5. The individual connections of a semantic connection must be
   bidirectional or have the same direction. The direction of the
   connection is determined by the direction of the source and
   destination feature and by the direction of the connection
   declarations.

6. If the feature connection is between two subcomponents, then nested
   features can be referenced arbitrarily deep. For connections up
   and down the hierarchy, the reference to a subcomponent feature
   is limited to a single feature identifier.

Standard Properties

Required Virtual Bus Class : **inherit list of** **classifier** (virtual
bus)

Required Connection Quality Of Service : **inherit list of** Supported
Connection\_QoS

Connection Pattern: **list of list of** Supported Connection Patterns

Connection Set: **list of** Connection Pair

Semantics

 Feature connections represent connections between abstract features,
or between an abstract feature and a concrete feature. Connection
patterns are specified as described in Section 9.2.3.

Feature connections can be used to connect (nested) elements of
subcomponent feature groups. A feature in a subcomponent feature
group may be connected individually as well as by a feature group
connection of the enclosing feature group â€“ resulting in separate
connections.

1. .. rubric:: Port Connections
  :name: port-connections

 Port connections represent directional transfer of data and control
between two concurrently executing components, i.e., between
threads, processors, and devices. They are feature connections,
whose source and destination are limited to ports and data access.

These connections are *semantic port connections*. A semantic port
connection is determined by a sequence of one or more individual
port connection declarations that follow the component containment
hierarchy in a fully instantiated system from an *ultimate source*
to an *ultimate destination*. In a partial AADL model the ultimate
source and destination of a semantic port connection are the ports
of leaf components in the containment hierarchy, i.e., a thread
group, process, or system without subcomponent.

 Semantic port connections are illustrated in Figure 14. The
*ultimate source* of a semantic port connection is an outgoing port
of a thread, virtual processor, processor, or device component, or
is a data component. The *ultimate destination* of a semantic port
connection is an incoming port of a thread, virtual processor,
processor, or device component, or is a data component. In the case
of a bidirectional connection between **in out** ports either port
can be the ultimate source or destination.

Port connection declarations follow the containment hierarchy of
threads, thread groups, processes and systems, or devices,
processors, and systems. An individual port connection declaration
links an outgoing port of one subcomponent to an incoming port of
another subcomponent, i.e., it connects sibling components at the
highest level in the component hierarchy required for the
connection. Alternatively, a port connection declaration maps an
outgoing port of a subcomponent to an outgoing port of a containing
component or an incoming port of a containing component to an
incoming port of a subcomponent. In other words, these connections
traverse up and down the containment hierarchy.

 Semantic port connections also represent the sampling of a data
component content by a data or event data port, and updating a data
component with the output of a data or event data port. In other
words, the ultimate source or the ultimate destination of a semantic
port connection, but not both, can be a data component.

Semantic port connections may also route a raised event to a modal
component through a sequence of connection declarations. A mode
transition in such a component is the ultimate destination of the
connection, if the mode transition names an incoming event port in
the enclosing component, or an outgoing event port of one of the
subcomponents (see Section 12).

 Semantic port connections may exist between arrays of component
instances. In this case, the Connection\_Pattern or Connection\_Set
property specifies which source array elements have a semantic
connection to which destination array element (see section 9.2.3 for
more detail).

 This section defines the concepts of departure and arrival times of
port connection transmission for each type of *port connection*. The
transfer semantics between periodic threads can be defined such that
they ensure deterministic sampling of data. All other communication
can be defined to be sampling or data driven. The inputs and outputs
can be specified to occur at dispatch, any time during execution, at
completion, or at deadline.

Naming Rules

1. The connection identifier in a port connection refinement declaration
   must refer to a named port or feature connection declared in an
   ancestor component implementation.

1. A source or destination reference in a port connection declaration
   must reference a port declared in the component type, a port of one
   of the subcomponents, or a port that is an element of a feature group
   in the component type, or it must refer to a requires data access in
   the component type, a provides data access in one of the
   subcomponents, or a data subcomponent.

2. The subcomponent reference may also consist of a reference to a
   subcomponent array.

3. The internal event or event data identifier must reference an
   internal event or event data declared in the component implementation
   or one of its ancestors.

Legality Rules

1. In the case of a directional port connection the connection end
   representing the source of the flow must be the source of the
   connection and the connection end representing the destination of
   the flow must be the destination of the connection.

2. In the case of a bidirectional port connection either connection end
   can be the source. If the bidirectional connection has
   directional connection ends, then the flow is determined by the
   direction of the connection ends. In the case of ports it is the
   port direction and in the case of data access features it is the
   access right.

3. If the source connection end is a data access feature it must have
   read access rights; if the destination connection end is a data
   access feature it must have write access rights.

1. The feature identifier of a subcomponent reference may refer to a
   feature array, if the subcomponent is a thread, device, or
   processor.

2. The following are acceptable sources and destinations of port
   connections. The left column shows connections between ports,
   while the right column shows connection between ports and data
   components.

+-------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| event port -> event port| data, data access -> data port, event data port, event port   |
| |   |
| data port -> data port, event data port, event port | data port, event data port -> data, data access   |
| |   |
| event data port -> event data port, data port, event port   |   |
+=============================================================+===============================================================+
+-------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+

The direction of the source port of a port connection declaration must
be compatible with the direction declared for the destination port as
defined by the following rules:

1. If the port connection declaration represents a connection between
   ports of sibling components, then the source must be an outgoing
   port and the destination must be an incoming port. If the source
   connection end is a data access feature, then it must be a
   **provides** access feature; if it is a destination connection
   end it must be a **requires** access feature.

2. If the port connection declaration represents a connection between
   ports up the containment hierarchy, then the source and
   destination must both be outgoing ports. If the source connection
   end is a data access feature, then it must be a **provides**
   access feature; if it is a destination connection end it must be
   a **requires** access feature.

3. If the port connection declaration represents a connection between
   ports down the containment hierarchy, then the source and
   destination must both be incoming ports. If the source connection
   end is a data access feature, then it must be a **requires**
   access feature; if it is a destination connection end it must be
   a **provides** access feature.

4. The individual connections of a semantic port connection must be
   bidirectional or have the same direction. The direction of the
   connection is determined by the direction of the source and
   destination feature and by the direction of the connection
   declarations.

5. **Self.**\ <identifier> may be referenced as the source or
   destination of a connection.

6. A data port cannot be the destination of more than one semantic port
   connection unless each semantic port connection is contained in a
   different mode.

7. A semantic connection cannot contain connection declarations with
   both immediate and delayed Timing property values.

8. For connections between data ports, event data ports and data access,
   the data classifier of the source port must match the data type
   of the destination port. The Classifier\_Matching\_Rule property
   specifies the rule to be applied to match the data classifier of
   a connection source to the data classifier of a connection
   destination.

9. The following rules are supported:

-  Classifier\_Match: The source data type and data implementation must
   be identical to the data type or data implementation of the
   destination. If the destination classifier is a component type, then
   any implementation of the source matches. This is the default rule.

-  Equivalence: An indication that the two classifiers of a connection
   are considered to match if they are listed in the
   Supported\_Classifier\_Equivalence\_Matches property. Acceptable data
   classifier matches are specified as
   Supported\_Classifier\_Equivalence\_Matches property with pairs of
   classifier values representing acceptable matches. Either element of
   the pair can be the source or destination classifier. Equivalence is
   intended to be used when the data types are considered to be
   identical, i.e., no conversion is necessary. The
   Supported\_Classifier\_Equivalence\_Matches property is declared
   globally as a property constant.

-  Subset: A mapping of (a subset of) data elements of the source port
   data type to all data elements of the destination port data type.
   Acceptable data classifier matches are specified as
   Supported\_Classifier\_Subset\_Matches property with pairs of
   classifier values representing acceptable matches. The first element
   of each pair specifies the acceptable source classifier, while the
   second element specifies the acceptable destination classifier. The
   Supported\_Classifier\_Subset\_Matches property is declared globally
   as a property constant. A virtual bus or bus must represent a
   protocol that supports subsetting, such as OMG DDS.

-  Conversion: A mapping of the source port data type to the destination
   port data type, where the source port data type requires a conversion
   to the destination port data type. Acceptable data classifier matches
   are specified as Supported\_Type\_Conversions property with pairs of
   classifier values representing acceptable matches. The first element
   of each pair specifies the acceptable source classifier, while the
   second element specifies the acceptable destination classifier. The
   Supported\_Type\_Conversions property may be declared globally as a
   property constant. A virtual bus or bus must support the conversion
   from the source data classifier to the destination classifier.

1. If more than one port connection declaration in a semantic port
   connection has a property association for a given connection
   property, then the resulting property values must be identical.

2. A processor port specification must only be used in event connections
   within threads and subprograms.

Consistency Rules

1. There cannot be cycles of immediate connections between threads,
   devices, and processors.

1. The processor port identifier of a processor port specification
   (**processor**.\ *processor\_port\_*\ identifier) must name a port of
   the processor that the thread is bound to.

2. The Supports\_Classifier\_Subset\_Matches property may be associated
   with a bus or virtual bus. This specifies the subset matches a
   particular protocol supports. Subset matches of connections bound to
   such a virtual bus or bus must be supported by the respective virtual
   bus or bus.

3. The Supports\_Type\_Conversions property may be associated with a bus
   or virtual bus. This specifies the subset matches a particular
   protocol supports. Subset matches of connections bound to such a
   virtual bus or bus must be supported by the respective virtual bus or
   bus.

Semantics

Port Connection Characteristics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 A semantic port connection represents directed flow of data and
control between threads, processors and devices. In the case of
event or event data ports the ultimate destination can be a mode
transition of a component.

A port connection can refine a feature connection. A port connection
can be refined by changing the direction from bidirectional to
directional, by adding a **in modes** subclause, and by adding
property associations for the connection in a connection refinement
declaration.

 A port connection declared with the optional
in\_modes\_and\_transitions subclause specifies whether the
connection is part of specific modes or is part of the transition
between two specific modes. The detailed semantics of this subclause
are defined in Section 12.

 While in a given mode, transmission over a port connection only
occurs if the connection is part of the current mode.

(5) During a mode switch, transmission over a data port connection only
occurs at the actual time of mode switch if the port connection is
declared to apply to the transition between two specific modes. The
actual mode switch initiates transmission. This allows data state to
be transferred between threads active in different modes. Similarly,
for event or event data ports it allows for transfer of queue
content.

(6) Port connections may refer to an event source specification
(**self**.event or event data name). An event source specification
indicates that the component itself is the source of an event. In
the case of a thread this may be due to a *Send\_Output* system call
or due to an event raised by the underlying runtime system, i.e.,
the processor. For all components it may represent the fact that a
component fault is the source of an event or a message (event data
port) with fault information to support diagnostics, as specified by
the Error Model Annex (see Annex Document C).

(7) A thread or device may be connected to the port of a processor. For
example, a health monitoring thread may receive the heart beat
events from several processors. In addition, a port connection may
refer to the port of the processor that an application software
component is bound to (**processor** . <portname> ). If a processor
or device is the data connection source, then the transmission is
initiated and completed when the destination thread or device is
dispatched. In this case a data port can model a processor or device
register that is sampled by a thread or device. If a device or
processor is the event connection source, then the occurrence of an
interrupt represents the initiation of an event transmission.

(8) AADL supports the following port connection declarations:

-  Event port, data port, event data port, data (data access) -> event
   port: port output or written data is recognized as event and queued
   in the event port.

-  Event data port, data port, data (data access) -> event data port:
   data output or written data is transferred and received as event data
   in a queued port.

-  Data port, event data port, data (data access) -> data port: Data
   output or written data is transferred and available upon receipt as
   most recent value of a data port variable, i.e., the data port
   samples data.

  A port connection to a mode transition is declared by naming the
 event port or event data port in the mode transition declaration
 (see Section 12).

 1. .. rubric:: Port Connection Topology
   :name: port-connection-topology

 The AADL supports n-to-n connectivity for event and event data
 ports. A port may have multiple outgoing connections, i.e., its
 content is transmitted to multiple destinations. This means that
 each destination port receives an instance of the event, or event
 data being transmitted. Similarly, event and event data ports can
 support multiple incoming connections resulting in sequencing and
 possibly queuing of incoming events and event data.

  For example, multiple threads may connect their outgoing event data
 port to an enclosing process event data port (fan-in), this port is
 connected to an incoming process event data port, and this port is
 connected to multiple thread ports (fan-out). This results in
 semantic connections from all ultimate source threads to all
 ultimate destination threads. If the port connections from multiple
 threads are declared to a feature group in the enclosing process, a
 feature group connection to a second process, and port connections
 from the feature group of the second process to its contained
 threads, the result is a collection of pair wise semantic
 connections from the ultimate source threads to the ultimate
 destination threads.

  Data ports are restricted to 1-n connectivity, i.e., a data port
 can have multiple outgoing connections, but only one incoming
 connection per mode. Since data ports hold a single data state
 value, multiple incoming connections would result in multiple
 sources overwriting each otherâ€™s values in the destination port
 variable.

(5)  Data ports can be used to model aggregate data ports. If data ports
 are declared with a data component type that has its data
 subcomponents externally visible through provides data access
 declarations, then a separate connection can be declared to each of
 these elements in the port of the enclosing component. For example,
 several periodic threads can deliver their data port results to a
 data port of the enclosing process that represents the aggregate of
 those data values as elements of its data component type. The set
 of threads whose output is considered are those whose dispatch
 aligns. Once they have produced their output, the aggregate output
 is sent to the recipients. The time at which the send is initiated
 is the latest completion of the source threads, i.e.,
 max(t\ :sub:`complete`), where t\ :sub:`complete` represents the
 value of t at completion time. Similarly, the recipient thread may
 receive an element of the aggregate data port of its enclosing
 process, or a subset of the elements. The latter is modeled by the
 classifier of the recipient data port satisfying the Subtype or
 Subset matching rules of the Classifier\_Matching\_Rule property.

(6)  Feature groups may have multiple outgoing and incoming connections
 unless any ports that are elements of a feature group place
 additional restrictions. A destination feature group may be a
 subset of the source feature group. Acceptable matches are
 specified via the Classifier\_Matching\_Rule property with values
 Subtype or Subset.

(7)  If a component has an **in out** port, this port may be the
 destination of a connection from one component and the source of a
 connection to another component. This can be expressed by two
 directional port connections. Bidirectional flow between two
 components is represented by a bidirectional port connection
 between the **in out** ports of two components.

 1. .. rubric:: Connection Patterns for Component Arrays and Feature
   Arrays
   :name: connection-patterns-for-component-arrays-and-feature-arrays

(8)  The Connection\_Pattern property specifies how semantic connections
 are replicated if the ultimate source and ultimate destination are
 component arrays. The ultimate source or destination is a component
 array if it or any enclosing component involved in the connection
 is declared as subcomponent array. The dimensions of the ultimate
 source and destination array is the sum of dimensions of the
 ultimate source/destination component and those of any enclosing
 component involved in the semantic connection. The order of the
 dimensions is from the ultimate source/destination component up the
 containment hierarchy.

(9)  The ultimate source or ultimate destination of a semantic
 connection may be a feature array. In this case, the dimension of
 the feature array is treated as an additional dimension (the first
 dimension if multiple dimensions exist).

(10) The Connection\_Pattern property is a multi-valued list of
 dimension pattern values. A dimension pattern value is a list
 itself with one value for each of the dimensions of component
 arrays. The number of dimension pattern values must correspond to
 the larger dimensionality of the source or destination component
 array. Each value specifies the intended connectivity for one
 dimension of the array. The following connection patterns are
 predefined for an array dimension:

-  An All\_To\_All value indicates that each array element of the
   ultimate source has a semantic connection to each element in the
   ultimate destination (broadcast). This connection pattern applies
   even if the two arrays have different sizes.

-  A One\_To\_One value indicates that elements of the ultimate source
   array and the ultimate destination array have pair wise semantic
   connections (Identity). This property value applies if the two arrays
   have identical sizes. If one range is a subset of the other then only
   the subset starting with the first element is connected.

-  A Next or Previous value indicates that elements of the ultimate
   source array dimension are connected to the next (previous) element
   in the ultimate destination array dimension. The last element does
   not connect in the case of next and the first element does not
   connect in the case of previous. This property value applies if the
   two arrays have identical sizes. Note that a Next value for two
   dimensions results in a diagonal connection.

-  A Cyclic\_Next or Cyclic\_Previous value indicates that elements of
   the ultimate source array dimension are connected to the next
   (previous) element in the ultimate destination array dimension. In
   the case of Cyclic\_Next the last element in the array connects to
   the first, and vice versa for Cyclic\_Previous. This property value
   applies if the two arrays have identical sizes. Note that a Next
   value for two dimensions results in a diagonal connection.

-  A One\_to\_All value indicates that a single element of the ultimate
   source has a semantic connection to each element in the ultimate
   destination. This connection pattern is used when the destination
   array has a higher dimensionality than the source array. It specifies
   that any connection according to the other dimensions is being
   replicated for each element in this destination dimension, i.e., the
   outputs are broadcast in this dimension.

-  An All\_to\_One value indicates that each array element of the
   ultimate source has a semantic connection to a single element in the
   ultimate destination. This connection pattern is used when the
   destination array has a lower dimensionality than the source array.
   It specifies that any connection according to the other dimensions is
   being replicated for each element in this source dimension, i.e., the
   outputs of this dimension are connected to a single fan-in point.

-  Even\_to\_Even value indicates that each even array element of the
   ultimate source has a semantic connection to the same even element in
   the ultimate destination. This connection pattern is used for a one
   to one mapping for even indices.

-  Odd\_to\_Odd value indicates that each odd array element of the
   ultimate source has a semantic connection to the same odd element in
   the ultimate destination. This connection pattern is used for a one
   to one mapping for odd indices.

-  A Next\_Next or Previous\_Previous value indicates that elements of
   the ultimate source array dimension are connected to the element
   after the next (previous) element in the ultimate destination array
   dimension. The last two elements do not connect in the case of
   next\_next and the first two element does not connect in the case of
   previous\_previous. This property value applies if the two arrays
   have identical sizes.

-  A Cyclic\_Next\_Next or Cyclic\_Previous\_Previous value indicates
   that elements of the ultimate source array dimension are connected to
   the element after next (previous) element in the ultimate destination
   array dimension. In the case of Cyclic\_Next\_Next the last two
   elements in the array connect to the first two, and vice versa for
   Cyclic\_Previous\_Previous. This property value applies if the two
   arrays have identical sizes.

 A list of Connection\_Pattern values permits more complex patterns
to be defined. Figure 15 illustrates the use of connection patterns
in a two-dimensional array. In more complex patterns, the value of
((Next,One\_To\_One), (One\_To\_One,Next), (Previous,One\_To\_One),
(One\_To\_One,Previous)) indicates connections to all horizontal and
vertical neighbors, while ((Next,One\_To\_One), (One\_To\_One,Next),
(Previous,One\_To\_One), (One\_To\_One,Previous),
(Previous,Previous), (Next,Previous), (Previous,Next), (Next,Next))
includes diagonal neighbors as well.

|image15|

Figure âˆ’ Connection Patterns in 2-Dimensional Component Array
 

 The Connection\_Set property specifies each semantic connection
between elements of the source component array and destination
component array individually. The property has a list of pairs of
source and destination array indices. A source or destination array
index consists of a list **aadlinteger** values, one for each array
dimension. The first index is the value 1. The values for the
Connection\_Set property may be generated by a tool based on pattern
specification that is an annex extension of the core AADL.

If both Connection\_Pattern values and Connection\_Set values are
specified, the set of semantic connections is the union of both.

Port Communication Timing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The content of incoming data, event, or event data ports is frozen
 for the duration of a thread execution, i.e., the port variable
 content as it is accessible to the component application code is
 not affected by the arrival of new data, events or event data. By
 default the input is frozen at the time of the dispatch, i.e., at
 the time when t = 0. If the Input\_Time property is specified it is
 determined by the property value as specified in Section (14). Any
 input arriving after the input time becomes available at the next
 input time. This may be the input time for the next dispatch, or
 the next input time in the same dispatch, if multiple input time
 values are specified.

 The output is transferred to other components at completion time,
 i.e., c = c\ :sub:`complete`, or as specified by the value of the
 Output\_Time property (see Section (14)). Output may be sent
 multiple times during the same dispatch; this is specified by
 multiple output time values.

  Event and event data ports may trigger the dispatch of a Sporadic,
 Aperiodic, or Timed thread as specified in Section 5.4.2. The
 content of data, event, and event data ports is processed at the
 dispatch rate. In case of event and event data ports, the input is
 the queued set of items at Input\_Time; each arrived event or event
 data is only processed once, and items can be processed one per
 dispatch or in batches.

  Arrival of events on event ports can also trigger a mode switch if
 the event port is named in a mode transition originating in the
 current mode (see Section 12). Events that trigger mode transitions
 are not queued at event ports.

(5)  In case of incoming data ports, the input is the most recently
 arrived value at input time. This may be the same as the value at
 the previous dispatch. The dispatch rate determines the rate at
 which a data stream is sampled.

(6)  An incoming data stream may be sampled periodically by a periodic
 thread, or it may be sampled at the rate at which Aperiodic,
 Sporadic, Hybrid, and Timed threads are dispatched. In this case
 the sampling thread samples the data stream at its dispatch rate
 independent of the dispatch and completion of the source thread. If
 the incoming port is a data port the most recent value is
 available. If the incoming port is an event port or event data port
 the content of the port queue may be sampled.

(7)  The actual transfer of data to data ports as ultimate destination
 is affected by the Transmission\_Type property, which specifies
 whether the ultimate source or ultimate destination initiate the
 transfer, with the default being the ultimate source.

(8)  The actual transfer of event data and events is affected by the
 Fan\_Out\_Policy property of ports with multiple outgoing
 connection declarations (see Section 9.2.6).

 1. .. rubric:: Sampled, Immediate, and Delayed Data Port
   Communication
   :name: sampled-immediate-and-delayed-data-port-communication

(9)  The source of a data stream may be a data or event data port of a
 periodic thread or device. When this data stream is sampled by a
 periodic thread or device, sampling, oversampling, and
 undersampling may occur non-deterministically due concurrency and
 preemption. This can lead latency jitter in the data and
 instability in control system behavior. AADL supports deterministic
 sampling of data streams between a periodic source and destination
 thread by specifying immediate and delayed timing of port
 connections.

(10) Sampled data port communication occurs when a periodic destination
 thread or device with an incoming data port samples a data stream.
 In a sampling semantic connection the recipient samples the output
 of the sender at dispatch time or as specified by the *Input\_Time*
 property of the recipient port. Since this sampling occurs
 independent of the dispatch and completion of the source thread the
 data stream is sampled non-deterministically as illustrated in
 Figure 16. It shows two threads executing concurrently at 10 Hz and
 20 Hz on different processor cores. The output of the first
 dispatch of Thread 1 is received by the second dispatch of Thread
 2. The output of the second dispatch of Thread 1 is received by the
 fifth dispatch of Thread 2, since the fourth dispatch of T2 occurs
 before the second dispatch of T1 completes.

Figure âˆ’ Sampling Data Port Connection
  

 Port connections can also be declared to be deterministic, i.e.,
they are declared to have an *immediate* or *delayed* Timing
property value. If the ultimate source and destination of a semantic
connection are periodic threads or devices and the ultimate
destination is a data port, then a semantic connection with an
immediate or delayed Timing property value imposes special
communication timing semantics.

In an immediate semantic connection the sender always communicates
with the receiver mid-frame, i.e., in the same dispatch frame. In
this case the receiver, when dispatched at the same time or at the
first dispatch after the sender dispatch, waits for the sender to
complete its execution. The scheduler must ensure that the execution
of the receiver is aligned with the completion of the sender.

 In a delayed semantic connections the sender always communicates
with the recipient phase-delayed, i.e., in the next dispatch frame
of the recipient after the deadline of the sender. In this case, the
send and receipt times are specified in terms of clock time, thus,
ensuring determinism. The communication mechanism takes care of
delaying the communication and the scheduler is unaware of this
delay.

 Deterministic sampling is ensured within a synchronization domain.
In the case of asynchronous systems, deterministic sampling is not
guaranteed unless appropriate protocols are provided by the runtime
system to ensure logically coordinated sampling that accommodates
time drift across synchronization domains.

(5) Immediate and delayed connection timing are illustrated in Figure
17. Thread 1 and Thread 2 are two periodic threads executing at a
rate of 10Hz, i.e., they are logically dispatched every 100 ms.
Immediate connection timing semantics are shown on the left of the
figure, and delayed are shown on the right of the figure.

(6) For immediate connection timing the actual start of execution of the
receiving thread (Thread 2) will be delayed if its dispatch occurs
at the same time or after the dispatch of the sending thread (Thread
1) and before execution completion of the sending thread. At the
actual start time the sending thread **out** port data value is
transferred into the **in** port of the receiving thread. For
example, if Thread 2 executes at twice the rate of Thread 1, then
the execution of Thread 2 will be delayed every time the two periods
align to receive the data at completion of Thread 1. Every other
time Thread 2 will start executing at its dispatch time with the old
value in its data port.

(7) For delayed connection timing, the data is not made available to the
recipient until the deadline of the source thread. The data is
available at the destination port at the next dispatch of the
destination thread that occurs at or after the source thread
deadline. If the source deadline and the destination dispatch occur
at the same logical time instant, the transmission is considered to
occur within the same time instant. The output of Thread 1 is made
available to Thread 2 at the beginning of its next dispatch. Thread
1 producing a new output at the next dispatch does not affect this
value.

Note: The data transfer of a delayed connection may be initiated at the
time of send, but the runtime system must ensure through double
buffering that the data is not moved to the in port variable for receipt
by the recipient until after the deadline of the sender.

Figure âˆ’ Timing of Immediate & Delayed Data Connections
   

  If the connection declarations that comprise a semantic port
 connection have an explicit Timing property association, then the
 value must be the same. The property is only interpreted if the
 source and destination are periodic and the destination feature is
 a data port.

 For immediate data port connections data transfer occurs at
 completion time of the sender (c:sub:`source` =
 c\ :sub:`complete,source`) and the receiver execution start time is
 delayed until the sender completes (c:sub:`destination` = 0 âˆ§
 c\ :sub:`source`\ â‰¤c\ :sub:`complete,source`). Both the source and
 destination must complete their execution by the deadline of the
 destination, i.e., (c:sub:`source` = c\ :sub:`complete,source` âˆ§
 c\ :sub:`destination` = c\ :sub:`complete,destination` âˆ§
 t\ :sub:`destination` â‰¤ Deadline\ :sub:`destination`). This rule is
 transitive for sequences of immediate semantic connections. Note
 that the output may occur at a time before completion as specified
 by the Output\_Time property. In this case,
 c\ :sub:`complete,source` becomes c\ :sub:`output\_time,source`.

  For delayed data port connections data transmission is initiated at
 the deadline of the source component (t:sub:`source` =
 Deadline\ :sub:`source`, i.e., the output time of the source data
 port is Deadline\_Time). The input time of the receiving component
 port is the Dispatch\_Time, i.e., the data is received at the next
 dispatch of the receiving component following or equal to the
 source deadline.

  For immediate connections the Input\_Time is assumed to be start
 time with zero offset and any other specified time is ignored. The
 Output\_Time is assumed to be completion time or must be specified
 as a single output time value.

(5)  For delayed connections the Input\_Time is assumed to be dispatch
 time and Output\_Time is assumed to be deadline.

(6)  If multiple transmissions occur for a data port connection from the
 source thread before the dispatch of the destination thread, then
 only the most recently transmitted data is available in the
 destination port. In other words, the destination thread
 *undersamples* the transmitted data. In the case of two connected
 periodic threads, this situation occurs when the source thread has
 a shorter period than the destination thread. In the case of a
 periodic thread connected to an aperiodic thread, this situation
 occurs if the aperiodic thread receives two dispatch events with an
 inter-arrival time larger than the period of the source thread. In
 the case of an aperiodic thread connected to a periodic thread,
 this situation occurs if the aperiodic thread has two successive
 completion times less than the period of the periodic thread.

(7)  If no transmission occurs on an in data port between two dispatches
 of the destination thread, then the thread receives the same data
 again, resulting in *oversampling* of the transmitted data. A
 status indicator is accessible to the source text of the thread as
 part of the port variable to determine whether the data is fresh.
 This allows a receiving thread to determine whether a connection
 source is providing data at the expected rate or fails to provide
 data.

 1. .. rubric:: Semantic Port Connections and Port Queues
   :name: semantic-port-connections-and-port-queues

(8)  If the ultimate destination of a semantic port connection is an
 event port or event data port, then this port has by default a
 queue of size one. The size of this queue can be changed by
 explicitly with the Queue\_Size property.

(9)  Ports that are part of the sequence of connection declarations of a
 semantic connection can have a fan-out policy called of OnDemand.
 Such a fan-out policy results in queuing of data and events for
 retrieval by the ultimate destination (see Section 8.3.3).

(10) This means that the output from the ultimate source of a semantic
 connection is passed into the queue of the first port with an
 OnDemand fan-out policy and more than one outgoing connection; in
 the case of a single outgoing connection the output can be passed
 on without queuing.

(11) If the port of the ultimate destination of a semantic connection
 does not receive input from a semantic connection, then it services
 the queue of the last port in its connection declaration sequence
 with an OnDemand fan-out policy, more than one outgoing connection,
 and at least one semantic connection that provides input into its
 queue. If a port with an OnDemand fan-out policy only receives
 input from one port with an OnDemand fan-out policy, then that port
 is the port to be serviced.

(12) If the ultimate destination is a thread or device with multiple
 ports that can trigger a dispatch, then they are serviced according
 to the rules specified for the Urgency property in Section 8.3.3.

(13) More complex queue processing patterns can occur if a port with
 OnDemand fan-out policy and more than one outgoing connection has
 input from an ultimate source of a semantic connection and from
 another port with OnDemand fan-out, or from multiple ports with
 OnDemand fan-out, In the former case, the other port queue is only
 serviced if the original queue is empty. In the latter case one of
 those port queues can be chosen according to a fan-in
 prioritization of the port.

(14) If the ultimate destination of a semantic port connection is a mode
 transition, then the arrival of an event or event data at the port
 queue results in immediately passing of a mode transition trigger
 event to the mode transition, in addition to its queuing in the
 port queue for the purpose of ultimate destination dispatch and
 input (see also Section 12).

Processing Requirements and Permissions

 The temporal semantics for port connections define several cases in
which the transmission initiation and completion times are
identical. While it is not possible to perform a transmission
instantaneously in a actual system, a method of implementing systems
must supply a thread execution schedule that preserves the temporal
and logical semantics of the model. In some cases, this may result
in a system where the actual sending thread completion time occurs
before the logical departure time of the transmission. Similarly,
the actual receiving thread may begin its execution after the
logical arrival of the transmission. Such an execution model is
acceptable if the observed causal order is identical to that of the
logical semantic model and all timing requirements specified in all
property associations are satisfied.

For port connections between periodic threads, the standard
semantics and default property associations result in undersampling
when the period of the sending thread is less than the period of the
receiving thread. Oversampling occurs when the period of the sending
thread is greater than the period of the receiving thread. A method
of implementing systems is permitted to provide an optimization
which may eliminate any physical transfers of data that can be
guaranteed to be overwritten, or that can be guaranteed to be
identical to previously transferred values. Error-free transmission
may be assumed when performing such an optimization.

 A method of building systems must include a runtime capability in
every system to detect an erroneous or failed transmission over a
data connection between periodic threads to the degree of assurance
required by an application. A method of building systems must
include a runtime capability in every system to report a failure to
perform a transmission by a sending periodic thread to all connected
recipients. A method of building systems must include a runtime
capability in every system to detect data errors in arriving
transmissions over any connection to the degree of assurance
required by an application. The source language annex to this
standard specifies the application program interface used to obtain
error information about transmissions. A method of building systems
may define additional error semantics and error detection mechanisms
and associated application programming interfaces.

 Port connections can have shared data components as source. This
requires the runtime system to monitor write operations to the data
component. A method of building systems may choose to not support
this capability.

(5) Deterministic communication expressed by immediate and delayed
connections must be guaranteed by the method of implementation
within a synchronization domain. Even if the transmission is
initiated and completed by explicit send and receive service calls
in the source text of the sending and receiving thread, the send and
receive order of the two communicating threads must be assured. A
method of implementation may choose not to support immediate and
delayed connections across synchronization domains.

NOTE: All data values that arrive at the data ports of a receiving
thread are immediately transferred at the logical arrival time into the
storage resources associated with those features in the source text and
binary image associated with that thread. A consequence of the semantic
rules for data connections is that the logical arrival time of a data
value to a data port contained in a thread always occurs either when
that thread is dispatchable or during an interval of time between a
dispatch event and a delayed start of execution, e.g., due to an
immediate connection. That is, data values will never be transferred
into a threadâ€™s data ports between the time it starts executing and the
time it completes executing and suspends awaiting a new dispatch unless
such an input time is specified through the Input\_Time property.

Arriving event and event data values may be queued in accordance with
the queuing rules defined in the port features section. A consequence of
the semantic rules for event and event data connections is that there
will be exactly one dispatch of a receiving thread for each arriving
event or event data value that is not lost due to queue overflow, and
event data values will never be transferred into a thread between the
time it starts executing and the time it completes and suspends awaiting
a new dispatch.

Parameter Connections
---------------------

 Parameter connections represent flow of data between the parameters
of a sequence of subprogram calls in a thread. Parameter connections
may be declared from an incoming data or event data port of the
containing thread to an incoming parameter of a subprogram call.
Parameter connections also specify connections from an incoming
parameter of the containing subprogram to an incoming parameter of a
subprogram call, from an outgoing parameter of a subprogram call to
an outgoing parameter of the containing subprogram, and from an
outgoing parameter of a subprogram call to an incoming parameter of
a subprogram call or to an outgoing data or event data port of the
containing thread. In addition, parameters may be connected to data
components (either to data subcomponents or data access features) to
represent data flowing to and from static and local variables. In
summary, the parameter connections follow the containment hierarchy
of subprogram calls nested in other subprograms. This is illustrated
in Figure 18. The call order is from left to right.

|image16|

Figure âˆ’ Parameter Connections
  

 For parameter connections, data transfer occurs at the time of the
subprogram call and call return. In the case of subprogram calls to
remote subprograms, the data is first transferred to a local proxy
and from there passed to the remote subprogram.

Naming Rules

1. The connection identifier in a parameter connection refinement
   declaration must refer to a named parameter or feature connection
   declared in an ancestor component implementation.

1. A source (destination) reference in a parameter connection
   declaration must reference a parameter of a preceding (succeeding)
   subprogram call, a parameter declared in the component type of the
   containing subprogram, a data port or event data port declared in the
   component type of the enclosing thread, a data port or event data
   port that is an element of a feature group in the component type of
   the enclosing thread, a data subcomponent, or a requires data access
   to a data component.

Legality Rules

1. The source of a parameter connection must be an incoming data or
   event data port of the containing thread, an incoming parameter
   of the containing subprogram, or a data subcomponent or requires
   data access with read-only or read-write access rights, or an
   outgoing parameter of a previous subprogram call.

1. The following source/destination pairs are acceptable for parameter
   connection declarations:

+--------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| threadport -> call.parameter | requiresdataaccess -> call.parameter|
+==================================================+=====================================================+
| threadfeaturegroup.port -> call.parameter| featuregroup.requiresdataaccess -> call.parameter   |

| containedcall.parameter -> parameter | datasubcomponent -> call.parameter  |
+--------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| parameter -> containedcall.parameter | call.parameter -> call.parameter|
+--------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+

1. A parameter cannot be the destination feature reference of more than
   one parameter connection declaration unless the source feature
   reference of each parameter connection declaration is contained
   in a different mode. In this case, the restriction applies for
   each mode.

2. The data classifier of the source and destination must match. The
   matching rules as specified by the Classifier\_Matching\_Rule
   property apply (see Section 9.2 (L13)). By default the data
   classifiers must be match.

Semantics

 Parameter connections represent sequential flow of data through
subprogram parameters in a sequence of subprogram calls being
executed by a thread.

Parameter connections are restricted to 1-n connectivity, i.e., a
data port or parameter can have multiple outgoing connections, but
only one incoming connection.

 If a subprogram has an **in out** parameter, this parameter may be
the destination of an incoming parameter connection and the source
of outgoing parameter connections.

 Parameter connections follow the call sequence order of subprogram
calls. In other words, parameter connection sources must be
preceding subprogram calls, and parameter connection destinations
must be successor subprogram calls.

(5) The optional in\_modes\_and\_transitions subclause specifies what
modes the parameter connection is part of. The detailed semantics of
this subclause are defined in Section 12.

Examples

NOTE: An example of parameter connections can be found in Section 5.2.

Access Connections
------------------

 Access connections represent access to shared data components by
concurrently executing threads or by subprograms executing within
thread. They also denote communication between processors, memory,
and devices by accessing a shared bus. Finally, they represent a
subprogram call to a specific instance of a subprogram or subprogram
group. If the subprogram or subprogram group resides in a different
thread, then the call is treated as a remote call. Access
connections for subprograms and subprogram groups are bidirectional.
Data, virtual bus, and bus access connections may be bidirectional
or directional. If they are directional they indicate write or read
access to the data component or bus component.

A *semantic access connection* is defined by a sequence of one or
more individual access connection declarations that follow the
component containment hierarchy from an *ultimate source* to an
*ultimate destination*.

 In the case of bidirectional connections either the subcomponent
being accessed or the feature that requires access can be the
ultimate source or destination. In the case of directional data
access connections the ultimate source is the source of the data
flow, e.g., the data component in the case of a read access and the
ultimate destination in the case of a write access. In the case of
partial AADL models, the ultimate source or destination may be a
provides access feature of a component without subcomponents.

 Figure 19 illustrates a semantic data connection from the data
component D to thread Q. The access connection is bidirectional,
thus, the data component could be the ultimate destination as well.

Figure âˆ’ Semantic Access Connection For Data Components
   

 The flow of data of a semantic data, virtual bus, or bus access
connection can also be indicated by the Access\_Right property on
the shared component or the access feature. In the case of a
directional access connection, the connection direction must be
consistent with the access rights.

Naming Rules

1. The connection identifier in an access connection refinement
   declaration must refer to a named access or feature connection
   declared in an ancestor component implementation.

1. An access reference in an access connection declaration must
   reference an access feature of a subcomponent, subprogram call, or
   **processor**, an access feature in the component type of the
   containing component, an access feature in a feature group of the
   containing component type, or a data, bus, virtual bus, subprogram,
   or subprogram group subcomponent.

Legality Rules

1. The category of the source and the destination of a access connection
   declaration must be the same, i.e., they must both be **data**,
   **bus**, **virtual bus**, **subprogram**, or **subprogram
   group**, or their respective access feature.

1. In the case of a bidirectional semantic access connection either
   connection end can be the source.

2. In the case of a directional data, virtual bus, or bus access
   connection the connection end representing the component being
   accessed must be the source for read access, and the destination
   for write access, i.e., the direction declared for the access
   connection must be compatible with the direction of the data flow
   for reading or writing based on the access rights, if specified.

3. In a partial AADL model the ultimate source or destination may be a
   provides access feature of a component instead of the
   subcomponent.

The **provides** and **requires** indicators of source and destination
access features must satisfy the following rules:

1. If the access connection declaration represents an access connection
   between access features of sibling components, then the source
   must be a **provides** access, and the destination must be a
   **requires** access, or vice versa.

2. If the access connection declaration represents a feature mapping up
   the containment hierarchy, then one connection end must be a
   **provides** access of a subcomponent, or a data, subprogram, or
   bus subcomponent; and the other connection end must be a
   **provides** access feature of the enclosing component or a
   **provides** feature of a feature group of the enclosing
   component.

3. If the access connection declaration represents a feature mapping
   down the containment hierarchy, then one connection end must be a
   **requires** access of the enclosing component, a **requires**
   access of a feature group of the enclosing component, or a data,
   subprogram, virtual bus, or bus subcomponent; and the other
   connection end must be a **requires** access of a subcomponent.

4. An access connection must not lead to more than one virtual bus, bus,
   data, or subprogram subcomponent unless the connection is mode
   specific. In this case, the restriction applies for each mode.

5. For access connections the classifier of the provider access must
   match to the classifier of the requires access according to the
   Classifier\_Matching\_Rules property. By default the classifiers
   must be the same (see Section 9.1).

6. If more than one access feature in a semantic access connection has
   an Access\_Right property association, then the resulting
   property values must be compatible. This means that the provider
   must provide read-only or read-write access if the requirer
   specifies read-only. Similarly, the provider must provide
   write-only or read-write access if the requirer specifies
   write-only. The provider must provide read-write access if the
   requirer specifies read-write. Finally, the provider must provide
   by-method access if the requirer specifies by-method access.

7. The category of the access connection source and destination must be
   identical. If the component category is specified as part of the
   connection declaration, then it must be identical to that of the
   source and destination. **Bus**, **virtual bus**, **data**,
   **subprogram**, and **subprogram group** are acceptable
   categories.

Standard Properties

Connection Pattern: **list of list of** Supported Connection Patterns

Connection Set: **list of** Connection Pair

Semantics

 A data access connection represents access to a shared data
component by concurrently executing threads or by subprograms
executing within thread. A subprogram access or subprogram group
access connection represents access to subprogram code or a library
that calls can be made to. The call may be a remote call. A bus
access connection represents communication between processors,
memory, and devices by accessing a shared bus.

Access connections are restricted to 1-n connectivity, i.e., a data,
subprogram, or bus component can have multiple outgoing access
connections, but a **requires** access feature can only have one
connection. The restriction of one connection applies to each mode,
i.e., different incoming access connections may exist in different
modes, but not in the same mode.

 The optional in\_modes subclause specifies what modes the access
connection is part of. The detailed semantics of this subclause are
defined in Section 12.

 The actual data flow through data, virtual bus, and bus access
connections is determined by the value of the Access\_Right property
on the shared data or bus component and their provides and requires
access declarations. Read means flow of data from the shared
component to the component requiring access, and write means flow of
data from the component requiring access to the shared component.
The desired data flow can also be indicated by specifying the
direction in the access connection declaration.

(5) The connection patterns for component arrays described in Section
9.2.3 apply to access connections as well.

\|

-- feature group element in a feature group of the component type

*component\_type\_feature\_group*\ \_identifier .

*element\_feature\_group\_*\ identifier

Naming Rules

1. The connection identifier in a feature group connection refinement
   declaration must refer to a feature group named connection declared
   in an ancestor component implementation.

1. A source or destination reference in a feature group connection
   declaration must reference a feature group declared in the component
   type, a feature group of one of the subcomponents, or feature group
   that is an element of a feature group in the component type. The
   subcomponent reference may also consist of a reference on a
   subcomponent array.

Legality Rules

1. If the feature group connection declaration represents a component
   connection between sibling components, the feature group types
   must be complements. This may be indicated by both feature group
   declarations referring to the same feature group type and one
   feature group declared as **inverse of**, by the feature group
   type of one feature group being declared as the **inverse of**
   the feature group type of the other feature group, or by the two
   referenced feature group types meeting the complement
   requirements as defined in Section 8.2.

1. The Classifier\_Matching\_Rule property specifies the rule to be
   applied to match the feature group classifier of a connection
   source to that of a connection destination.

2. The following rules are supported for feature group connection
   declarations that represent a connection up or down the
   containment hierarchy:

-  Classifier\_Match: The source feature group type must be identical to
   the feature group type of the destination. This is the default rule.

-  Equivalence: An indication that the two classifiers of a connection
   are considered to match if they are listed in the
   Supported\_Classifier\_Equivalence\_Matches property. Matching
   feature group types are specified by the
   Supported\_Classifier\_Equivalence\_Matches property with pairs of
   classifier values representing acceptable matches. Either element of
   the pair can be the source or destination classifier. Equivalence is
   intended to be used when the feature group types are considered to be
   identical, i.e., their elements match. The
   Supported\_Classifier\_Equivalence\_Matches property is declared
   globally as a property constant.

-  Subset: An indication that the two classifiers of a connection are
   considered to match if the inner feature group has outcoming features
   that are a subset of outgoing features of the outer feature group,
   and if the inner feature group has incoming features that are a
   subset of incoming features of the outer feature group. The pairs of
   features are expected to have the same name.

1. The following rules are supported for feature group connection
   declarations that represent a connection between two
   subcomponents, i.e., sibling component:

-  Classifier\_Match: The source feature group type must be the
   complement of the feature group type of the destination. This is the
   default rule.

-  Equivalence: An indication that the two classifiers of a connection
   are considered to match with opposite direction if they are listed in
   the Supported\_Classifier\_Equivalence\_Matches property. Matching
   feature group types are specified by the
   Supported\_Classifier\_Equivalence\_Matches property with pairs of
   classifier values representing acceptable matches. Either element of
   the pair can be the source or destination classifier. Equivalence is
   intended to be used when the feature group types are considered to be
   identical, i.e., their elements match with opposing direction. The
   Supported\_Classifier\_Equivalence\_Matches property is declared
   globally as a property constant.

-  Subset: An indication that the two classifiers of a connection are
   considered to match if each has incoming features that are a subset
   of outgoing features of the other. The pairs of features are expected
   to have the same name.

A feature group may have a direction declared; otherwise it is
considered bidirectional. The direction declared for the destination
feature group of a feature group connection declaration must be
compatible with the direction declared for the source feature group as
defined by the following rules:

1. If the feature group connection declaration represents a connection
   between feature groups of sibling components, then the source
   must be an outgoing feature group and the destination must be an
   incoming feature group.

2. If the feature group connection declaration represents a connection
   between feature groups up the containment hierarchy, then the
   source and destination must both be an outgoing feature group.

3. If the feature group connection declaration represents a connection
   between feature groups down the containment hierarchy, then the
   source and destination must both be an incoming feature group.

4. A feature group connection must be bidirectional or constrains the
   direction of the flow from the source and destination feature.

Semantics

 These connections represent a collection of *semantic connections*
between the individual features in each group. A semantic feature
connection is determined by a sequence of one or more individual
connection declarations that follow the component containment
hierarchy in a fully instantiated system from an *ultimate source*
to an *ultimate destination*. As the connection declarations follow
the component containment hierarchy they may involve the aggregation
of features into feature groups up the hierarchy and decomposition
into individual features down the hierarchy.

 Feature groups and feature group connections may impose a
restriction on the direction of the collection of features and
connections they represent.

Processing Requirements and Permissions

 When an AADL model with a thread architecture and fully detailed
feature groups is instantiated, each semantic connection of feature
group elements is included in the instance model. If the feature
groups of such a model are incomplete a connection instance between
the feature group instances is created. If the AADL model is not
fully detailed to the thread level, connection instances are created
between the leaf components in the system hierarchy.

Flows
=====

 A *flow* is a logical flow of data and control through a sequence of
threads, processors, devices, and port connections or data access
connections. A component can have a flow specification, which
specifies whether a component is a flow source, i.e., the flow
starts within the component, a flow sink, i.e., the flow ends within
the component, or there exists a flow path through the component,
i.e., from one of its incoming ports to one of its outgoing ports.

The purpose of providing the capability of specifying end-to-end
flows is to support various forms of flow analysis, such as
end-to-end timing and latency, reliability, numerical error
propagation, Quality of Service (QoS) and resource management based
on operational flows. To support such analyses, relevant properties
are provided for the end-to-end flow, the flow specifications of
components, and the ports involved in the flow to be analyzed. For
example, to deal with end-to-end latency the end-to-end flow may
have properties specifying its expected maximum latency and actual
latency. In addition, ports on individual components may have flow
specific properties, e.g., an **in** port property specifies the
expected latency of data relative to its sensor sampling time or in
terms of end-to-end latency from sensor to actuator to reflect the
latency assumption embedded in its extrapolation algorithm.

 Flows are represented by flow specification, flow implementation,
and end-to-end flow declarations.

A flow specification declaration in a component type specifies an
externally visible flow through a componentâ€™s ports, feature groups,
parameters, or data access features. The flow through a component is
called a *flow path*. A flow originating in a component is called
the *flow source*. A flow ending in a component is called the *flow
sink*.

 A flow implementation declaration in a component implementation
specifies how a flow specification is realized in the implementation
as a sequence of flows through subcomponents along connections from
the flow specification origin to the flow specification destination.
This is illustrated in Figure 20. The system type S1 is declared
with three ports and two flow specifications. These are the flows
through system S1 that are externally visible. In the example, both
flows are flow paths, i.e., they flow through the system. The ports
identified by the flow specification do not have to have the same
data type, nor do they have to be the same port type, i.e., one can
be an event port and the other an event data port. This allows flow
specifications to be used to describe logical flows of information.

 The system implementation for system S1 is shown on the right of
Figure 20. It contains two process subcomponents P1 and P2. Each has
two ports and a flow path specification as part of its process type
declaration. The flow implementation of flow path F1 is shown in
both graphical and textual form. It starts with port pt1, as
specified in the flow specification. It then follows a sequence of
connections and subcomponent flow specifications, modeled in the
figure as the sequence of connection C1, subcomponent flow
specification P2.F5, connection C3, subcomponent flow specification
P1.F7, connection C5. The flow implementation ends with port pt2, as
specified in the flow specification for F1.

Figure âˆ’ Flow Specification & Flow Implementation
 

 An end-to-end flow is a logical flow through a sequence of system
components, i.e., threads, devices and processors. An end-to-end
flow is specified by an end-to-end flow declaration. End-to-end flow
declarations are declared in component implementations, typically
the component implementation in the system hierarchy that is the
root of all threads, data components, processors, and devices
involved in an end-to-end flow. The subcomponent identified by the
first subcomponent flow specification referenced in the end-to-end
flow declaration contains the system component that is the starting
point of the end-to-end flow. Succeeding named subcomponent flow
specifications contain additional system components. In the example
shown in Figure 20, the flow specification F7 of process P1 may have
a flow implementation that includes flows through two threads which
is not included in this view of the model.

1. .. rubric:: Flow Specifications
  :name: flow-specifications

 A flow specification declaration indicates that information
logically flows from one of its incoming ports, parameters, or
feature groups to one of its outgoing ports, parameters, or feature
groups, or to and from data components via data access. The ports
can be event, event data, or data ports. A flow may start within the
component, called a *flow source*. A flow may end within the
component, called a *flow sink*. Or a flow may go through a
component from one of its **in** or **in out** ports or parameters
to one of its **out** or **in out** ports or parameters, called a
*flow path*. A flow may also follow read or write access to data
components. In the case of feature groups, there is a flow from a
feature group to its inverse.

 Multiple flow specifications can be defined involving the same
features. For example, data coming in through an **in** feature
group is processed and derived data from one of the feature groupâ€™s
contained ports is sent out through different **out** ports.

Naming Rules

1. The defining flow identifier of a flow specification must be unique
   within the interface name space of the component type.

1. The flow feature identifier in a flow path must refer to a port,
   parameter, data access feature, or feature group in the component
   type, or to a port, data access feature, or feature group contained
   in a feature group in the component type, or to a parameter of a
   subprogram access feature.

2. The defining flow identifier of a flow specification refinement must
   refer to a flow specification or refinement in an ancestor component
   type.

Legality Rules

1. The direction declared for the *out\_flow* of a flow path
   specification declaration must be compatible with the direction
   declared for the *in\_flow* as defined by the following rules:

1.  If the *in\_flow* is a port or parameter, its direction must be must
be an **in** or an **in out**.

2.  If the *out\_flow* is a port or parameter, its direction must be an
**out** or an **in** **out**.

3.  If the *in\_flow* is a data access, its access right must be must be
Read\_Only or Read\_Write.

4.  If the *out\_flow* is a data access, its direction must be
Write\_Only or Read\_Write.

5.  If the *in\_flow* is a feature group then it must contain at least
one port or data access that satisfies the above rule, or it
must have an empty set of ports.

6.  If the *out\_flow* is a feature group then it must contain at least
one port or data access that satisfies the above rule, or it
must have an empty set of ports.

7.  The direction declared for the out flow of a flow source
specification declaration must be the same as for out flows in
flow paths.

8.  The direction declared for the *in\_flow* of a flow sink
specification declaration must be the same as for *in\_flow* of
flow paths.

9.  If the flow specification refers to a feature group then the feature
group must contain at least one port, data access, or parameter
that satisfies the above rules, or the feature group must have
an empty list of features.

10. If the *out\_flow* is a subprogram access feature parameter then its
direction must be **out** or **in out.**

11. If the *in\_flow* is a subprogram access feature parameter then its
direction must be **in** or **in out.**

Standard Properties

Latency: Time Range

NOTE: These properties are examples of properties for latency and
throughput analysis. Additional properties are also necessary on ports
to fully support throughput analysis, such as arrival rate and data
size. Appropriate properties for flow analysis may be defined by the
tool vendor or user (see Section 11).

Semantics

 A flow specification declaration represents a logical flow
originating from within a component, flowing through a component, or
ending within a component.

In case of a flow through a component, the component may transform
the input into a different form for output. In case of data or event
data port, the data type may change. Similarly the flow path may be
between different port types, e.g., an event port and a data port,
and between ports, parameters, data access features, and feature
groups. This permits end-to-end flows to be specified as logical
information flows through a system despite the fact that the
information is being manipulated and its representation changed.

Flow Implementations
--------------------

 Component implementations must provide an implementation for each
flow specification. A flow implementation declaration identifies the
flow through its subcomponents. In case of a flow source
specification, it starts from the flow source of a subcomponent or
from the component implementation itself and ends with the port
named in the flow source specification. In case of a flow sink
specification, the flow implementation starts with the port named in
the flow sink specification declaration and ends within the
component implementation itself or with the flow sink of a
subcomponent. In case of a flow path specification, the flow
implementation starts with the *in\_flow* port and ends with the
*out\_flow* port. Flow characteristics modeled by properties on the
flow implementation are constrained by the property values in the
flow specification. Flow implementations can be declared to be
mode-specific.

\| data\_component\_reference

data\_component\_reference ::=

*data\_subcomponent\_*\ identifier \|
*requires\_data\_access*\ \_identifier

\| *provides\_data\_access*\ \_identifier

Naming Rules

1. The flow identifier of a flow implementation must name a flow
   specification in the component type. A flow implementation name may
   appear more than once in each component implementation, either as
   alternative flows under different modes or transitions (using **in
   modes**), or to represent multiple flows for the same flow
   specification such as replicated flows to support redundancy or
   different flows for different elements of feature groups.

1. The *in\_flow* and *out\_flow* feature identifier in a flow
   implementation must refer to the same *in\_flow* and *out\_flow*
   feature as the flow specification it implements.

2. The subcomponent flow identifier of a flow implementation must name a
   subcomponent and optionally a flow specification in the component
   type of the named subcomponent, or it must name a data component in
   the form of a data subcomponent, provides data access, or requires
   data access.

3. In case of a flow source implementation the flow identifier of the
   first subcomponent must refer to a flow source or a data component.

4. In case of a flow sink implementation the flow identifier of the last
   subcomponent must refer to a flow sink or a data component.

5. In all other cases the subcomponent flow identifier must refer to a
   flow path or a data component.

6. The connection identifier in a flow implementation must refer to a
   connection in the component implementation.

Legality Rules

1. The source of a connection named in a flow implementation declaration
   must be the same as the *in\_flow* feature of the flow
   implementation, or as the out flow feature of the directly
   preceding subcomponent flow specification, if present.

1. The destination of a connection named in a flow implementation
   declaration must be the same as the out flow feature of the flow
   implementation, or as the in\_flow feature of the directly
   succeeding subcomponent flow specification, if present.

2. The *in\_flow* feature of a flow implementation must be identical to
   the *in\_flow* feature of the corresponding flow specification.
   The *out\_flow* feature of a flow implementation must be
   identical to the *out\_flow* feature of the corresponding flow
   specification.

3. If the component implementation provides mode-specific flow
   implementations, as indicated by the **in** **modes** statement,
   then the set of modes in the **in** **modes** statement of all
   flow implementations for a given flow specification must include
   all the modes for which the flow specification is declared.

4. In case of a mode-specific flow implementation, the connections and
   the subcomponents named in the flow implementation must be
   declared at least for the modes listed in the **in** **modes**
   statement of the flow implementation.

5. Flow implementations may be declared from an *in\_flow* feature
   directly to an *out\_flow* feature.

6. Component type extensions may refine flow specifications and
   component implementation extensions may refine subcomponents and
   connections with **in** **modes** statements. A flow
   implementation that is inherited by the extension must be
   consistent with the modes of the refined flow specifications,
   subcomponents, and connections if named in the flow
   implementation according to rules (L4) and (L5). Otherwise, the
   flow implementation has to be defined again in the component
   implementation extension and satisfy rules (L4) and (L5).

7. Component implementation extensions may declare flow implementations
   for flow specifications that were already declared in the
   component implementation being extended.

Consistency Rules

1. If the component implementation has subcomponents, then a flow
   implementation declaration is required for each flow specification
   for a fully refined flow.

Semantics

 A flow implementation declaration represents the realization of a
flow specification in the given component implementation. Different
mode-specific flow implementations may be declared for the same flow
specification.

A flow path implementation starts with the port or data access named
in the corresponding flow specification, passes through zero or more
subcomponents, and ends with the port or data access named in the
corresponding flow specification (see Figure 20). A flow source
implementation ends with the port or data access named in the
corresponding flow specification. A flow sink implementation starts
with the port or data access named in the corresponding flow
specification. A flow path implementation may specify a flow that
goes directly from an *in\_flow* feature to an *out\_flow* feature
without any connections in between.

 A flow implementation may refer to subcomponents without identifying
a flow specification in the subcomponent. In this case, (a) an
unnamed flow specification is assumed to exist from the destination
port of the preceding connection to the source port of the
succeeding connection if no flow specification is declared for the
subcomponent, (b) it represents a separate flow for each of the flow
specifications of the subcomponent.

 A flow implementation within a thread may be modeled as flow through
subprogram calls via their parameters. If the call is to a
subprogram via a subprogram access feature, the flow goes to the
subprogram instance being called. This may be a subprogram in a
different thread that is called remotely.

(5) A flow through a component may transform the input into a different
form for output. In case of data, event data port, or data access,
the data type may change. Similarly the flow path may be between
different port types, between ports and feature groups, and between
data access and ports or feature groups. This permits end-to-end
flows to be specified as logical information flows through a system
despite the fact that the information is being manipulated and its
representation changed.

(6) The optional in\_modes\_and\_transitions subclause specifies what
modes the flow implementation is part of. The detailed semantics of
this subclause are defined in Section 12.

(7) Flow specifications can have component implementation specific and
mode specific property values. The respective property associations
can be declared in the properties subclause of the component
implementation declaration.

End-To-End Flows
----------------

 An end-to-end flow represents a logical flow of data and control
from a source to a destination through a sequence of threads that
process and possibly transform the data. In a complete AADL
specification, the source and destination can be threads, data
components, devices, and processors. In an incomplete AADL
specification, the source and destination are the leaf nodes in the
component hierarchy, which may be thread groups, processes, or
systems. If the AADL specification includes subprogram calls, the
end to end flow follows the semantic connections between threads,
processors, and devices, and the parameter connections within
threads.

Naming Rules

1. The connection identifier in an end-to-end flow declaration must

2. The subcomponent flow identifier of an end-to-end flow declaration
   must name an optional flow specification in the component type of the

2. The *end*\ \_subcomponent\_flow\_identifier must refer to a
   subcomponent and optionally to a flow path or a flow sink, or to
   a data component.

3. If an end-to-end flow is referenced in an end-to-end flow

   the same port as the preceding or succeeding connection.

4. In case of a mode specific end-to-end flow declarations, the named

   redefined.

Standard Properties

Actual Latency: Time Range

NOTE: These properties are examples of properties for latency and
throughput analysis. The expected property values represent constraints
that must be satisfied by the actual property values of the end-to-end
flow. The semantics of the constraint are analysis specific.

Semantics

 An end-to-end flow represents a logical flow of information through
a system instance. The end-to-end flow is declared in a component
implementation that is the common root of all components involved in
the flow. The declared end-to-end flow starts with a subcomponent
flow specification, followed by zero or more connections and
subcomponent flow specifications, and ends with a connection and a
subcomponent flow specification. The end-to-end flow can involve
active components such as threads, thread groups, processes,
systems, processors, and devices, as well as passive components in
the form of a data component.

An end-to-end flow may refer to subcomponents without identifying a
flow specification. In this case, the flow specification (a) refers
to an unnamed flow specification from the destination port of the
preceding connection and the source port of the succeeding
connection if the subcomponent has no declared flow specification,
or (b) represents a separate end-to-end flow for each of the flow
specifications of the subcomponent.

 An end-to-end flow may be specified as a composition of other
end-to-end flows, where the last element of the predecessor
end-to-end flow is connected with the first element of the successor
end-to-end flow.

 The corresponding end-to-end flow instance is determined by
expanding the flow specifications through their flow
implementations. The resulting end-to-end flow instance starts from
a device, processor, data component, or thread that is the leaf of
the component hierarchy of the first subcomponent, follows semantic
connections to intermediate threads and ends with a thread, data
component, device, or processor. For incomplete models or flow
implementations the components involved in the end-to-end flow
instance may be thread groups, processes, or systems.

(5) If the first subcomponent flow specification is a flow path, then
the end-to-end flow instance starts with the first component of the
flow path expanded through its flow implementation. Similarly, if
the last subcomponent flow specification is a flow path, then the
end-to-end flow instance ends with the last component of the flow
path expanded through its flow implementation.

(6) The optional in\_modes\_and\_transitions subclause specifies what
modes the end-to-end flow is part of. The detailed semantics of this
subclause are defined in Section 12.

Properties
==========

 A property provides information about model elements, i.e.,
component types, component implementations, subcomponents, features,
connections, flows, modes, mode transitions, subprogram calls, and
packages. A property has a name, a type, and a value. The property
definition declares a name for a given property along with the AADL
components and functionality to which the property applies. The
property type specifies the set of acceptable values for a property.
Each property has a value or list of values that is associated with
the named property in a given specification.

 A property set contains declarations of property types and property
definitions that may appear in an AADL specification. The
predeclared property sets in this standard define properties and
property types that are applicable to all AADL specifications. Users
may define property sets that are unique to their model, project or
toolset. The properties and property types that are declared in
user-defined property sets are accessed using their qualified name.
A property definition declaration within a property set indicates
the component types, component implementations, subcomponents,
features, connections, flows, modes, and subprogram calls, for which
this property applies.

Properties can have associated expressions that are statically
typed, and evaluate to a specific value. The time at which a
property expression is evaluated may depend on the property and on
how a specification is processed. For example, some expressions may
be evaluated immediately, some after binding decisions have been
made, and some reflect runtime state information, e.g., the current
mode. During analysis, all property expressions can be evaluated to
known values, if necessary, by considering all possible runtime
states. A given property definition may have a default expression.

1. .. rubric:: Property Sets
  :name: property-sets

 A property set defines a named group of property types, property
definitions, and property constant values.

Syntax

property\_set ::=

**property set** *defining\_Â­property\_set*\ \_identifier **is**

{ import\_declaration }\ :sup:`\*`

{ property\_type\_declaration

\| property\_definition\_declaration

\| property\_constant }\ :sup:`\*`

{ annex\_subclause }\ :sup:`\*`

**end** *defining\_property\_set*\ \_identifier ;

Naming Rules

1. Property set defining identifiers must be unique in the global
   namespace.

1. The defining identifier following the reserved word **end** must be
   identical to the defining identifier following the reserved word
   **property** **set**.

2. Associated with every property set is a *property set namespace* that
   contains the defining identifiers for all property types, property
   definitions, and property constants declared within that property
   set. This means that property types, properties, and property
   constants with the same identifier can be declared in different
   property sets.

3. A property, property constant, or property type declared in a
   property set is always named by its qualified name that is the
   property set identifier followed by the property identifier,
   separated by a double colon (::). This qualification is necessary
   even for references to properties, property constants, and property
   types in the same property set due to the fact that predeclared
   properties do not have to be qualified. Predeclared properties and
   property types may be referred to by their property identifiers
   without a property set qualifier.

4. The property set identifiers and package names listed in an
   import\_declaration must exist in the global namespace.

5. The property set identifier of a qualified property name must be
   listed in an import\_declaration of the property set or package
   unless it is the name of the property set that contains the qualified
   name.

Semantics

 Property definitions, property types, and property constants are
organized into property sets. They are referenced by qualifying them
with the property set name. This qualification is not required if
the property set is one of the predeclared property sets.

An import\_declaration of a property set specifies which property
sets and packages can be named in qualified references to items in
other property sets.

1. .. rubric:: Property Types
  :name: property-types

 A property type declaration associates an identifier with a property
type. A property type denotes the set of legal values in a property
association that are the result of evaluating the associated
property expression.

property\_type

Naming Rules

1. All property type defining identifiers declared within the same
   property set must be distinct from each other, i.e., unique within
   the property set namespace.

1. A property type is named by its property type identifier or the
   qualified name specified by the property set/property type identifier
   pair, separated by a double colon (::). An unqualified property
   type identifier must be part of the predeclared property sets.

2. An enumeration type introduces an enumeration namespace. The
   enumeration literal identifiers in the enumeration list declare an
   ordered list of enumeration literals. They must be unique within this
   namespace.

3. A units type introduces a units namespace. The units identifiers in
   the units list declare a set of units literals. They must be unique
   within this namespace.

4. The units identifier to the right of a **=>** in a units literal
   statement must refer to a unit identifier defined earlier in the
   sequence of the same units type declaration.

5. The *classifier meta model identifier* must refer to a class in the
   AADL meta model or an Annex meta model. In the case of an Annex meta
   model, the identifier is qualified by the annex name. Acceptable
   classes are listed in tabular form in Appendix C.3 and in relevant
   Annex standards.

6. The *named element meta model identifier* must refer to a class in
   the AADL meta model or an Annex meta model that is a subclass of the
   *NamedElement* class and a structural feature, in the case of the
   AADL core language a subclass of the *ClassifierFeature* class. In
   the case of an Annex meta model, the identifier is qualified by the
   annex name. Acceptable classes are listed in tabular form in an
   appendix of this standard and in relevant Annex standards.

7. The identifiers of the property field declarations in a **record**
   property type must be unique within the record declaration, i.e., the
   record type represents a local namespace for record field
   identifiers.

Legality Rules

1. The value of the first numeric literal that appears in a range of a
   number\_type must not be greater than the value of the second
   numeric literal including the valueâ€™s units.

1. Range values must always be declared with unit literals if the
   property requires a unit literal.

2. The unique property constant identifier in an integer range must
   represent an integer constant. If the integer type requires
   units, then the constant value must include a unit literal of the
   specified units type.

3. A boundless range type may be declared such that the actual range
   declarations have no limit on the upper and lower bound.

4. The unique property constant identifier in a real range must
   represent a real constant. If the real type requires units, then
   the constant value must include a unit literal of the specified
   units type.

5. If the property requires a unit, then the unit must be specified for
   both lower and upper bound and the unit literal must be of the
   specified units type..

6. If a range is specified for **aadlinteger** or **aadlreal** then the
   actual value assigned to a property of this type must be within
   the specified range.

NOTE: In the original AADL standard reserved words were used to identify
the classifier category or reference category. Those names are
compatible with the qualified meta model identifiers of AADL V2 with the
exception of *connections*. It is now named *connection*.

Semantics

  A property type declaration associates an identifier with a
 property type.

 The **aadlboolean** property type represents the two values, true
 and false.

  The **aadlstring** property type represents all legal strings of
 the AADL.

  An **enumeration** property type represents an ordered list of
 enumeration identifiers as the set of legal values.

(5)  A **units** property type represents an explicitly listed set of
 measurement unit identifiers as the set of legal values. The second
 and succeeding unit identifiers are declared with a multiplier
 representing the conversion factor that is applied to a preceding
 unit to determine the value in terms of the specified measurement
 unit.

(6)  An **aadlreal** property type represents a real value or a real
 value and its measurement unit. If a units clause is present, then
 the type value is a pair of values, a real value and a unit. The
 unit may only be one of the enumeration literals specified in the
 units clause. If a units clause is absent, then the value is a real
 value

(7)  An **aadlinteger** property type represents an integer value or an
 integer value and its measurement unit. If a units clause is
 present, then the value is a pair of values, and unit may only be
 one of the enumeration literals specified in the units clause. If a
 units clause is absent, then the value is an integer value.

(8)  The **range** property type represents closed intervals of numbers.
 It specifies that a property of this type has a value that is a
 range term. The range type specifies the number type of values in
 the range. A property specifying a range term as its value
 indicates a least value called the lower bound of the interval, a
 greatest value called the upper bound of the interval, and
 optionally the difference between adjacent values called the
 **delta**. The delta may be unspecified, in which case the range is
 dense, but it is otherwise undefined whether the range is an
 interval of the real or the rational numbers.

(9)  A **classifier** property type represents the subset of
 syntactically legal classifier references, whose class is a
 subclass of the *Classifier* meta model class and of one of the
 meta model classes listed in the classifier identifier list. For
 core AADL this is typically the meta model class that represents a
 component category. If the classifier identifier list is absent,
 all classifier references are acceptable.

(10) A **reference** property type represents the subset of
 syntactically legal references to those model elements, whose class
 is a subclass of the meta model class *Named Element* and
 *ClassifierFeature* or a structural element of an annex clause. A
 *ClassifierFeature* is a structural element that is contained in a
 component, such as ports, flow specifications, subcomponents, or
 connections. If the identifier list is absent, all model elements
 whose class is a subclass of *NamedElement* and *ClassifierFeature*
 are acceptable.

(11) A **record** type represents a group of property associations,
 i.e., a collection of property values, where each element of the
 collection of property values is accessible by name. The record
 fields must be explicitly declared by name, each with its own
 property type.

NOTE: The classifier and reference property types support the
specification of properties representing binding constraints.

Units literals are not case sensitive. For example, *mW* and *MW*
represent the same units literal. Therefore, it is advisable to choose
literal names such as *milliWatts* and *MegaWatts*.

Examples

**property set** mine **is**

Length\_Unit : **type units** ( mm, cm => mm \* 10,

m => cm \* 100, km => m \* 1000 );

OnOff : **type aadlboolean**;

-- This type declaration references a separately declared units type

Car\_Length : **type aadlreal** 1.5 m .. 4.5 m **units**
mine::Length\_Unit ;

-- This type declaration defines the units in place

Speed\_Range : **type range of aadlreal** 0.0 kph .. 250.0 kph **units**
( kph );

Position : **type record** (

X: **aadlinteger**;

Y: **aadlinteger**; );

**end** mine;

 Property Definitions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 All property names that appear in a property association list must
be declared with property definition declarations inside a property
set. Properties are typed and are defined for any named element in
an AADL model.

Syntax

property\_definition\_declaration ::=

*defining\_property\_name*\ \_identifier\ **:**

[ **inherit** ]

( single\_valued\_property \| multi\_valued\_property )

**applies to** **(** property\_owner { **,** property\_owner
}\ :sup:`\*` **) ;**

single\_valued\_property ::=

property\_type\_designator [ **=>** *default*\ \_property\_expression ]

multi\_valued\_property ::=

{ **list of** }\ :sup:`+` property\_type\_designator

[ **=>** *default*\ \_property\_list\_value

]

property\_owner ::=

-- AADL or Annex meta model named element

*named\_element\_*\ qualified\_meta\_model\_identifier \|

unique\_classifier\_reference \| **all**

unique\_classifier\_reference ::=

package\_name **::** classifier\_identifier

NOTE: Different from AADL V1 the **access** keyword is no longer used in
property definitions. The fact that a property applies to an access
feature is already specified in the applies to clause.

Naming Rules

1. All defining identifiers of property definitions declared within the
   same property set must be distinct from each other and distinct from
   all property type defining identifiers declared within that property
   set. The property set namespace contains the defining identifiers for
   all property definitions declared within that property set.

2. A property is named by its property definition identifier or the
   qualified name specified by the property set/property definition
   identifier pair, separated by a double colon (::). An unqualified
   property identifier must be part of the predeclared property sets.

1. The named\_element\_meta\_model\_identifier must identify the name of
   a class in the AADL meta model or an Annex meta model that is a
   subclass of the AADL meta model class NamedElement. In case of an
   Annex meta model, the identifier is qualified by the annex name.
   Acceptable classes are listed in tabular form in an appendix of this
   standard and in relevant Annex standards.

2. The unique\_classifier\_reference must identify the name of a
   classifier in the public section of the named package.

Legality Rules

1. All properties are automatically defined for components of the
   category **abstract**, i.e., the category **abstract** is
   implicitly included in all **applies to** statements.

1. **Classifier** and **reference** property definition must not have a
   default value.

2. When the property owner is set to **all**, this is the only possible
   value.

Semantics

 A property definition declaration introduces a new property that is
of a specified property type, accepts a single value or a list of
values, and may specify a default property expression. This property
is defined for those named elements of an AADL model whose meta
model name is listed after the **applies to** in the list, or those
model elements that are of the specified component type. Acceptable
meta model names are listed in tabular form in Appendix C.3 of this
standard and in relevant Annex standards.

The Property\_Owner list may include component types qualified by a
package name. In this case, the property can only be associated with
components of this component type or its extensions. If the
Property\_Owner list includes NamedElement, then the property can be
associated with all model elements.

 A property defined with the reserved word **inherit** indicates that
if a property value cannot be determined for a component, then its
value will be inherited from a containing component. The detailed
rules for determining property values are described in Section 11.3.

 A property declared without a default value is considered undefined
(see also Section 11.3). A property declared to have a list of
values is considered to have an empty list if no default value is
declared.

Examples

-- added to Property Set mine from previous example

Value\_Type: **type enumeration** ( estimate, benchmark, measured );

Rotation\_Units: **type units** ( rpm );

Position : **type record** (

X: **aadlinteger**;

Y: **aadlinteger**; );

GPS\_Position : mine::Position **applies to** ( system );

Property Constants
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Property constants are property values that are known by a symbolic
name. Property constants are provided in the predeclared property
sets and can be defined in property sets. They can be referenced in
property expressions by name wherever the value itself is
permissible.

Syntax

property\_constant ::=

single\_valued\_property\_constant \| multi\_valued\_property\_constant

single\_valued\_property\_constant ::=

*defining\_property\_constant*\ \_identifier **:** **constant**

property\_type\_designator

**=>** *constant*\ \_property\_expression\ **;**

multi\_valued\_property\_constant ::=

*defining\_property\_constant*\ \_identifier **:** **constant** ( **list
of** )\ :sup:`+`

property\_type\_designator

**=>** *constant*\ \_property\_list\_value **;**

unique\_property\_constant\_identifier ::=

[ *property\_set*\ \_identifier **::** ]
*property\_constant*\ \_identifier

Naming Rules

1. The defining property constant identifier must be distinct from all
   other property constant identifiers, property definition identifiers,
   and property type identifiers in the namespace of the property set
   that contains the property constant declaration.

1. A property constant is named by its property constant identifier or
   the qualified name specified by the property set/property constant
   identifier pair, separated by double colon (::). An unqualified
   property constant identifier must be part of the predeclared property
   sets. Otherwise, the property constant identifier must appear in the
   property set namespace.

Legality Rules

1. A property constant cannot be declared for the **classifier**
   property type or the **reference** property type.

1. If a property constant declaration has more than one property
   expression, it must contain the reserved words **list of**.

2. The property type of the property constant declaration must match the
   property type of the constant property value.

Semantics

 Property constants allow integer, real, string, and other property
values to be known by symbolic name and referenced by that name in
property expressions. This reference is expressed by referencing the
unique property constant identifier.

Examples

Max\_Threads : **constant** **aadlinteger** => 256;

Predeclared Property Sets
-------------------------

 There is a standard collection of predeclared property sets named
Deployment\_Properties, Thread\_Properties, Timing\_Properties,
Memory\_Properties, Programming\_Properties, and
Modeling\_Properties, which are part of every AADL specification.
These property sets are listed in Appendix A .

In addition, there is property set AADL\_Project that declares a set
of enumeration property types and property constants for which
project-specific enumeration literals and values can be defined for
different projects. This property set is part of every AADL
specification. All of the property enumeration types and property
constants listed in Appendix A.2 must be declared in this property
set. The set of enumeration literals may vary.

Naming Rules

1. References to predeclared properties, property types, and property
   constants do not have to be qualified with the property set name. As
   a consequence the predeclared properties, property types, and
   property constants must be unique across all predeclared property
   sets.

NOTE: References to predeclared properties, property constants, and
property types may be qualified with their property set name.

Legality Rules

1. The predeclared property sets other than AADL\_Project cannot be
   modified.

1. Existing property type and property constant declarations in the
   AADL\_Project property set can be modified. New declarations must
   not be added to the AADL\_Project property set, but can be
   introduced through a separate property set declaration.

Processing Requirements and Permissions

 Additional property name declarations may not be inserted into the
standard predeclared property sets. Separate property set
declarations must be used for nonstandard property definitions.

Providers of AADL processing methods may modify the standard
property type declarations in AADL\_Project to allow additional
values for a specific property definitions. For example, additional
enumeration identifiers beyond those listed in this standard may be
added.

 Users may define additional property sets and use them in AADL
specifications. AADL tools may be created that make use of those
additional property sets.

 Additional property sets that may be suitable for a wide variety
applications may be defined in an Annex document. AADL tools that
support this Annex should include support for these additional
property sets. Similarly, AADL specifications that conform to the
Annex shall satisfy the requirements associated with the annex
property set.

1. .. rubric:: Property Associations
  :name: property-associations

 A property association assigns a property value or list of property
values with a property. This may involve evaluation of a property
expressions. Property associations can be declared within component
types, component implementations, subcomponents, features,
connections, flows, modes, and subprogram calls, as well as their
respective refinement declarations. Contained property associations
permit property values to be associated with any component in the
system instance hierarchy (see Section 13.1).

Naming Rules

1. A property is named by an optional property set identifier followed
   by a property identifier, separated by a double colon (::).

1.  The property set identifier, if present, must appear in the global
namespace and must be the defining identifier in a property set
declaration.

2.  The property identifier must exist in the namespace of the property
set, or if the optional property set identifier is absent, in the
namespace of any predeclared property set.

3.  A property name may appear in the property association clause only
if the respective AADL model element is listed in the applies to
list of the property definition declaration.

4.  The *contained model element path* identifies named model elements
in the containment hierarchy, for which the property value holds.
The model element with the contained property association is the
root of a path.

5.  For contained property associations declared with classifiers, e.g.,
a component type or component implementation, the first identifier
in the path must appear in the local namespace of the classifier to
which the property association belongs.

6.  For contained property associations declared with model elements
with a classifier reference, e.g., subcomponents, the first
identifier must appear as an identifier within the local namespace
of the classifier that is referenced by the model element.

7.  For contained property associations declared in annex subclauses
without an annex specific path fragment, the first identifier must
refer to an element in the namespace of the annex subclause that
contains the property association.

8.  For contained property associations declared in annex subclauses
with an annex specific path fragment, the first identifier of the
annex specific path must refer to an element in the namespace of the
annex subclause declared for the last path element in the core
model.

9.  Subsequent identifiers in a contained model element path must appear
in the namespace of the model element identified by the preceding
identifier.

10.  Identifiers in an annex-specific path must appear in the namespace
of the annex that contains the property association.

11. If the identifier of a contained model element path is a
subcomponent array identifier, it can specify a subcomponent array
as a whole, an array subset, or an individual array element.

12. If a property association has an **in binding** statement, then the
unique platform classifier reference must be referenceable according
to the **with** and **renames** declarations.

1. If a property association has mode-specific values, i.e., an **in
   modes** statement for values, then the mode must refer to a mode of
   the component the property is associated with, or in the case of a
   property association of model elements that are not components, the
   modes of the containing component.

2. A property association list must have at most one property
   association for the same property. In case of binding-specific
   property associations, there must be at most one association for each
   binding.

Legality Rules

1. The property definition named by a property association must list the
   class of the model element, with which the property is
   associated, or any of its super classes in its **applies to**
   clause.

1.  A contained property association with mode-specific values can only
be applied to a single model element, i.e., can only contain a
single containment path.

2.  If a property expression list consists of a list of two or more
property expressions, all of those property expressions must be
of the same property type.

3.  If the property declaration for the associated property definition
does not contain the reserved words **list of**, the property
value must be a single property value. If the property
declaration for the associated property definition contains the
reserved words **list of**, the property list value must have
the correct number of parentheses to match the list or nested
list declaration.

4.  The property association operator **+=>** must only be used if the
property declaration for the associated property definition
contains the reserved words **list of**.

5.  A property association with an operator **+=>** must not have an
**in modes** or **in binding** statement.

6.  The property association operator **+=>** must not be used in
contained property associations.

7.  In a property association, the type of the evaluated property
expression must match the property type of the named property.

8.  A property value declared by a property association with the
reserved word **constant** cannot be changed when the rules in
the *semantics* section for determining a property value are
followed.

9.  The unique component type identifiers in the **in binding**
statement must refer to component types of the categories
**processor**, **virtual processor**, **bus**, **virtual bus**,
or **memory.**

10. If a property value with an **in modes** statement is associated
with a connection, flow implementation, or call sequence with an
**in modes** statement, then the set of modes for which the
property value applies must be contained in the set of modes for
which the connection, flow implementation, or call sequence is
active.

11. Contained property associations with annex specific paths must be
declared in the respective annex subclause.

Consistency Rules

1. If a property association has mode-specific values, i.e., values
   declared with the **in modes** statement, then the modal value
   assignment must include a value for each mode. If the modal value
   assignment includes a value without the **in modes** statement, this
   value becomes the default for all modes without an explicit
   mode-specific value.

Semantics

  Property associations determine the property value of the model
 element instances in the system instance hierarchy (see Section
 13.1). The property association of a classifier, subcomponent,
 feature, flow, connection, mode, or subprogram call and other
 declarative model elements determines the property value of all
 instances derived from the respective declaration.

 A property association may be declared for a package. In this case,
 the property value applies to the package.

  The value of a property is determined through evaluation of the
 property expression.

  Property associations are declared in the properties subclause of
 component types and component implementations. They are also
 declared as part of any other named declarative model element, such
 as features, subcomponents, connections, modes, mode transitions,
 etc. The property association of a component type acts as default
 value for all implementations, subcomponents, and instances,
 overwriting the default specified in the property definition.
 Similarly, the property association of a component implementation
 overwrites the value of a component type, and the subcomponent
 property association overwrites the value of the component
 implementation. The details of determining a property value are
 specified below.

(5)  If a property association is declared with modal property values,
 then the same rules hold for overwriting previous property
 associations. Property values are modal if they are declared with
 an **in modes**. In this case the property value applies if one of
 the specified modes is active. If a property association contains
 both mode-specific associations and value without an **in modes**
 statement, then the latter specifies the value for all modes for
 which there is not an explicit value with an **in modes**
 statements. A property value without an **in modes** statement also
 applies when the component is inactive. If a modal property
 association does not specify a property value for one of the modes
 and there is no property value without **in modes**, then the
 property value is considered to be undefined.

(6)  If a property association has an **in binding** statement, the
 property value is binding-specific. The property value applies if
 the binding is to one of the specified execution platform types of
 the categories processor, virtual processor, bus, virtual bus, or
 memory. If a property association list contains both
 binding-specific associations and an association without an in
 binding statement, then the latter applies to bindings to the
 reference processor.

(7)  Contained property associations can associate property values to
 any named model element down the system hierarchy relative to the
 location of the declaration.

(8)  The **applies to** clause of a contained property association may
 specify multiple contained model element paths. In that case the
 property value is associated with each of the model elements. If
 the property association specifying contained model elements
 includes an **in modes** statement, then the named modes must exist
 in the last component of the contained element path. If the path
 refers to a model element that is not a component, e.g., a feature,
 then the modes must exist in the containing component of that model
 element.

(9)  A contained model element path may include the name of an array of
 components, or an index range of the array subset. In that case the
 property value is associated with each of the model elements in the
 array or its subset, or model elements identified by the remaining
 path for each of the array elements.

(10) Contained property associations can be used to record system
 instance specific property values for all model elements in a
 system instance. This permits AADL analysis tools to record system
 instance specific information about an actual system in a single
 location in an extension of the top-level system implementation.
 For example, a resource allocation tool can record the actual
 bindings of threads to processors and source text to memory through
 a set of contained property associations, and can keep multiple
 such binding configurations in different extensions of the same
 system implementation.

(11) The property value is determined according to the following rules:

-  If a property value is not present after applying all of the rules
   below, it is determined by the default value of its property
   definition declaration. If not present in the property definition
   declaration, the property value is undefined.

-  For classifier types, i.e., component types and feature group types
   and subclasses of ComponentType in Annex meta models, the property
   value of a property is determined by its property association in the
   properties subclause. If not present, the property value is
   determined by the first ancestor classifier type in the extends
   hierarchy with its property association. Otherwise, it is considered
   not present.

-  For classifier implementations, i.e., a component implementations and
   subclasses of ClassifierImplementation in Annex meta models, the
   property value of a property is determined by its property
   association in the properties subclause. If not present, the property
   value is determined by the first ancestor classifier implementation
   in the extends hierarchy with its property association. If not
   present, it is determined by the property value of the classifier
   implementationâ€™s classifier type according to the classifier type
   rules.

-  For modes, connections, flow sequences, or other model elements
   without a classifier reference, the property value of a property is
   determined by its property association in the element declaration. If
   not present and the model element is refined, then the property value
   is determined by a property association in the model element
   declaration being refined; this is done recursively along the
   refinement sequence. If not present and the property definition has
   been declared as **inherit**, it is determined by the property value
   of the closest containing component in the containment hierarchy of
   the system instance. This inherited property value must not be
   mode-specific. Otherwise, it is considered not present.

-  For subcomponents, features and other model elements with classifier
   references, the property value of a property is determined by its
   property association in the model element declaration. If not present
   and the model element is refined, then the property value is
   determined by a property association in the model element declaration
   being refined; this is done recursively along the refinement
   sequence. If not present in the model element, it is determined by
   the model elementâ€™s classifier reference according to the respective
   classifier rules described above. If not present for a feature that
   is a member of a feature group and the property definition has been
   declared as **inherit**, it is determined by the property value of
   the containing feature group type; or if not present and the feature
   group type is an extension of another freature group type, it is
   determined by the feature group type being extended. If not present
   and the property definition has been declared as **inherit**, it is
   determined by the property value of the closest containing component
   in the containment hierarchy of the system instance. This inherited
   property value must not be mode-specific. Otherwise, it is considered
   not present.

-  For subprogram calls in call sequences and other model elements with
   classifier or feature references, the property value of a property is
   determined by its property association in the model element. If not
   present and the reference is a classifier reference, the property
   value is determined by the classifier according to its rules
   described above. If not present and the reference is a feature
   reference in a type, the property value is determined by the feature
   according to the feature rules described above. If not present and
   the property definition has been declared as **inherit**, it is
   determined by the property value of the closest containing component
   in the containment hierarchy of the system instance. This inherited
   property value must not be mode-specific. Otherwise, it is considered
   not present.

-  For component, feature, connection, flow, mode, or other model
   element instances in the system instance hierarchy, the property
   value of a property is determined by the contained property
   association highest in the system instance hierarchy that references
   the component, feature, connection, flow, mode, or other model
   element. If not present, then the property value is determined by the
   respective subcomponent, mode, connection, feature, or other model
   element declaration that results in the instance according to the
   rules above. If not present and the property definition has been
   declared as **inherit**, then it is determined by the property value
   of the closest containing component in the containment hierarchy of
   the system instance. This inherited property value must not be
   mode-specific. Otherwise, it is undefined.

Figure âˆ’ Property Value Determination
 

 Figure 21 illustrates the order in which the value of a property is
determined. Instance4 is an element in the system instance
hierarchy. The value of one of its properties is determined by first
looking for a property associated with the instance itself â€“ shown
as step 1. This is specified by a contained property association.
The contained property association for this instance declared in a
component implementation highest in the instance hierarchy
determines that value. If no instance value exists, the
implementation (ImplA) of the instance is examined (step 2). If it
does not exist, ancestor implementations are examined (step 3). If
the property value still has not been determined, the component type
is examined (step 4). If not found there, its ancestor component
types are examined (step 5). If not found and the property is
inherited, for subcomponents and features, the enclosing
implementation is examined. Otherwise, the containing component in
the component instance hierarchy is examined (step 6). Finally, the
default value is considered.

Two property association operators are supported. The property
association operator **=>** results in a new value for the property.
The property association operator **+=>** results in the addition of
a value to a property value list. In the case of nested lists, the
value is added to the outermost list.

 A property value list is evaluated by evaluating each of the
property expressions, and appending the values in order. If the
property expression evaluates to a list, all the list elements are
appended. If the property expression evaluates to undefined, it is
treated as an empty list.

 A property value declared by a property association with the
reserved word **constant** cannot be changed. For example, if a
property association is defined as **constant** for a component
type, then there cannot be a property association for the same
property in any component implementation of the type, nor any
subcomponent, nor contained property association that applies to a
component of the component type.

(5) If the property type is a **record**, a property association
represents the assignment of a new record value. If a subset of
record fields is assigned a value, the remaining fields have an
undefined value and not inherited.

(6) Component instance property associations with specified contained
subcomponent identifier sequences allow separate property values to
be associated with each component instance in the containment
hierarchy. In particular, it permits separate property values such
as actual processor binding property values or result values from an
analysis method to be associated with each component in the system
instance containment hierarchy.

Naming Rules

1. The component type identifier or component implementation name of a
   subcomponent classifier reference must appear namespace of the
   specified package.

1. The enumeration identifier of a property expression must have been
   declared in the enumeration list of the property type that is
   associated with the property.

2. For reference terms the naming rules (N5) .. (N11) in Section 11.3
   are applicable in order to resolve contained model element paths.

3. If a **classifier** property is associated with a core AADL model
   element, then the classifier meta model identifier of a classifier
   term can only refer to a core AADL meta model class.

4. If a **classifier** property is associated with an AADL annex model
   element, then the classifier meta model identifier of a classifier
   term can refer to a core AADL meta model class or an annex meta model
   class of the same annex.

5. If a **reference** property is associated with a core AADL model
   element, then the contained model element path of a reference term
   can only refer to a core AADL model element. The first identifier in
   the path must be defined in the namespace of the directly enclosing
   component that contains the property association or the classifier of
   the subcomponent when associated with a subcomponent.

6. If a **reference** property is associated with an AADL annex model
   element, then the contained model element path of a reference term
   can refer to a core AADL model element or an annex model element of
   the same annex.

7. The field identifier of a record expression must exist in the local
   namespace of the record type.

8. The function identifier of a **compute** expression must exist as
   function in the source text.

Legality Rules

1. If the base type of a property number type or range type is integer,
   then the numeric literals must be integers.

1. The type of a property named in a property term must be identical to
   the type of the property name in the property association.

2. The type of a property constant named in a property constant term
   must match the type of the property name in the property
   association.

3. Property references in *property\_term* or *property\_constant\_term*
   of property expressions must be applicable to the model element
   to which the property association applies.

4. Property references in *property\_term* or *property\_constant\_term*
   of property expressions cannot be circular. If a property has a
   property expression that refers to a property or property
   constant, then that expression evaluation cannot directly or
   indirectly depend on the value of the original property or
   property constant.

5. If the contained model element path of a reference term includes a
   subcomponent array identifier that does not identify a single
   element in the array, then the expression results in a list of
   references.

Semantics

 Every property expression can be evaluated to produce a value, a
range of values, or a reference. It can be statically determined
whether this value satisfies the property type designator of the
property name in the property association. The value of the property
association may evaluate undefined, if no property association or
default value has been declared.

*Boolean terms* are of property type **aadlboolean**. The reserved
words **true** and **false** evaluate to the Boolean values true and
false.

*
*

  *Number terms* evaluate to a numeric value denoted by the numeric
 literal, or evaluate to a pair consisting of a numeric value and
 the specified units identifier. A number term satisfies an
 **aadlinteger** property type if the numeric value is a numeric
 literal without decimal point or exponent. Otherwise, it satisfies
 the **aadlreal** property type. If specified, the units identifier
 must be one of the unit identifiers in the unit designator of the
 property type. Furthermore, the value must fall within the
 optionally specified range of the property type â€“ taking into
 account unit conversion as necessary.

 *Enumeration terms* evaluate to enumeration identifiers. The
 **enumeration** property type of the property name is satisfied if
 the enumeration identifier is declared in the enumeration list of
 the property type.

  *Range terms* are of **range** property type and are represented by
 number terms for lower and upper range bounds plus and an optional
 **delta** value. Range terms evaluate to two or three numeric
 values that and each must satisfy the number type declared as part
 of the range property type. The **delta** value represents the
 maximum difference between two values, e.g., between two values of
 a data stream coming through a data port.

  *String terms* are of **aadlstring** property type. A string
 literal evaluates to the string of characters denoted by that
 literal.

(5)  *Property terms* evaluate to the value of the referenced property.
 This allows one property value to be expressed in terms of another.
 The value of the referenced property is determined in the context
 of the element for which the property value is being determined.
 For example, the Deadline property has the property term Period as
 its default property expression. If this default value is not
 overwritten by another property association, the value of Deadline
 of a thread subcomponent is determined by evaluating the property
 term in the context of the thread subcomponent, i.e., the Deadline
 value is determined by the Period value for the thread subcomponent
 rather than the context of the default value declaration. The value
 of the referenced property may be undefined, in which case the
 property term evaluates to undefined.

(6)  *Property constant terms* evaluate to the value of the referenced
 property constant. This allows one property value to be expressed
 symbolically in terms of a constant identifier rather than the
 actual value.

(7)  *Component classifier terms* are of the property type
 **classifier**. They evaluate to a classifier reference.

(8)  *Reference terms* are of **reference** property type and evaluate
 to a reference. This reference may be a reference to a model
 element in the model containment hierarchy, e.g., to a contained
 component, to a connection, mode, feature, or an annex model
 element.

(9)  *Record terms* evaluate to a record value, which consists of a
 separate value for each named field in the record expression. Any
 record field defined in a record type, for which there is no value
 in the record expression, the field value is determined by the
 default value; otherwise it is considered not present.

(10) *Computed terms* allow a user-defined function to be called to
 calculate a property value. This function is called every time the
 value of the property is accessed. This function gets the model
 element as input parameter. This function may access other
 properties of the same and other model elements to calculate its
 value and it is assumed to complete its computation in finite time.
 A typical use of this function is to calculate the value of a
 property based on the value of a property of its subcomponents. It
 takes the property association and the model element it is
 associated with as parameters. The function is expected to be
 without side effects and to return a value that is consistent with
 the type of the property. The function being called is assumed to
 exist in a library that is supplied to methods of processing.

NOTE: Expressions of the property type **reference** or **classifier**
are provided to support the ability to refer to classifiers and model
elements in the model. For example, they are used to specify bindings of
application components to execution platform components.

Processing Requirements and Permissions

 A method of processing specifications may define additional rules to
determine if an expression value is legal for a property, beyond the
restrictions imposed by the declared property type. The declared
property type represents a minimum set of restrictions that must be
enforced for every use of a property.

If an associated expression or default value is not specified for a
property, a method of processing specifications is permitted to
reject that specification as erroneous. A method of processing
specifications is permitted to construct a default expression,
providing that default is made known to the developers. This
decision may be made on a per property basis. If a property value is
not required for a specific development activity, then the method of
processing associated with this activity must accept a specification
in which that property has no associated value.

 A method of processing specifications may impose additional
restrictions on the use of property expressions whose value depends
on the current mode of operation, or on bindings. For example,
mode-dependent values may be allowed for some properties but
disallowed for others. Mode-dependent property expressions may be
disallowed entirely.

 A method of processing specifications may access and change field
values of a record property value programmatically.

(5) A method of processing specifications may impose restrictions on the
use of computed values in order to allow the computed value function
to compute the value once and store the result as a cached value.
For example, it may assume that the values of properties used in the
computation have been declared through property associations. In
that case the computed property value is not changed
programmatically by a method of processing and can be determined at
model instantiation time.

Modes and Mode Transitions
==========================

 A *mode* represents an operational mode state, which manifests
itself as a configuration of contained components, connections, and
mode-specific property value associations. Modes can be defined for
different components in a system and modes can be inherited from the
enclosing component. A configuration may be an execution platform
configuration in the form of a set of processors, memories, buses,
and devices; an application system configuration in the form of a
set of threads communicating through connections or calls within or
across processes and systems; or a source text operational mode
within a thread, i.e., an execution behavior embedded in the source
text itself. When multiple modes are declared for a component, a
mode transition behavior declaration identifies which event and
event data arrivals cause a mode switch and the new mode, i.e., a
change to a different configuration. Exactly one mode is considered
the current mode. The current mode determines the set of threads
that are considered *active*, i.e., ready to respond to dispatches,
and the connections that are available to transfer data and control.
A set of modes may be inherited from the containing component.

 Mode transitions model dynamic operational behavior that represents
switching between configurations and changes in components internal
characteristics. Such transitions are initiated by mode transition
triggering events, i.e., the arrival of events or event data on
ports named in a mode transition or an event raised by the component
itself (**self**). When declared for processes and systems, mode
transitions model the switch between alternative configurations of
active threads. When declared for execution platforms, mode
transitions model the change between different execution platform
configurations. When declared for threads and subprograms, modes may
represent application logic that is encoded in the source text and
may result in different associated property values for the thread or
data component.

mode\_or\_transition ::=

*mode*\ \_identifier \| *mode\_transition*\ \_identifier

Naming Rules

1. The defining mode and mode transition identifiers must be unique
   within the local namespace of the component classifier that contains
   the mode subclause. This means that modes declared in component types
   and in component implementations for the same type must have
   different identifiers.

1. The identifiers in a mode transition that refer to modes must exist
   in the local namespace of the component classifier that contains the
   mode subclause. In other words, mode transitions of a component can
   only refer to modes of the same component.

2. The unique feature identifier must be either incoming feature
   identifier in the namespace of the associated component type, or an
   outgoing feature identifier in the namespace of the component type
   associated with the named subcomponent. The internal feature
   identifier or processor feature identifier must exist in the
   namespace of the component implementation that contains the mode
   subclause.

3. The mode and mode transition identifiers named in an **in modes**
   statement of a subcomponent or connection must refer to modes or mode
   transitions declared in the local namespace of the component
   implementation that contains the subcomponent or connection. The
   modes and mode transitions in the local name space are those declared
   in the modes\_subclause or requires\_modes\_subclause of the
   component implementation or the component type.

4. The subcomponent\_mode\_identifier in a component\_in\_modes must
   refer to a required mode of the subcomponent for which the **in
   modes** is declared. If the subcomponentâ€™s component type has a
   **requires modes** clause and no mapping to a subcomponent mode
   identifier is specified, then for each such mode in the subcomponent
   there must be a mode with the same name in the containing component.

5. An **in modes** statement in a subcomponent or connection refinement
   declaration may be used to specify mode membership to replace the
   one, if any, in the declaration being refined. A subcomponent or
   connection refinement declaration without an **in modes** statement
   specifies that the connection is active in all modes.

Special rules apply for **in modes** in property associations (see
Section 11.3).

1. For a contained property association with an **in modes** statement,
   the identifier must refer to modes or mode transitions of the last
   subcomponent named in the dot-separated identifier list of the
   **applies to** subclause, or to modes and mode transitions of the
   component containing the property association if the **applies to**
   subclause does not start with a subcomponent identifier.

Legality Rules

1. A mode or mode transition can be declared in any of the component
   categories.

1. If a component classifier contains mode declarations, one of those
   modes must be declared with the reserved word **initial**. If the
   component classifier extends another component classifier, the
   initial mode must have been declared in one of the ancestor
   component classifier. This rule does not apply to **requires
   modes** subclauses.

2. The set of transitions declared within a single component
   implementation must define a deterministic transition function.
   For each mode, there must exist exactly one transition, which can
   cause transition to another mode.

3. If a component has been declared with a requires\_mode\_clause, then
   a subcomponent declaration referencing this component classifier
   may include a component\_in\_modes that specifies a mapping for
   the inherited modes by specifying the subcomponentâ€™s mode
   identifier after the optional **=>**; if the mapping is not
   specified the same mode identifier is assumed.

Standard Properties

Mode Transition Response: **enumeration** ( emergency, planned )

Semantics

**Mode Sensitive Architecture**

  The mode semantics described here focus on a single mode subclause.
 A system instance that represents the runtime architecture of an
 operational system can contain multiple components with their own
 mode transitions. The semantics of system-wide mode transitions are
 discussed in Section 13.6.

 A mode represents an operational state that is represented as a
 runtime configuration of contained components, connections, and
 mode-specific property value associations.

  A mode may represent a runtime configuration of systems, processes,
 thread groups and threads and their connections for a given
 operational state. In this case the modes are declared in thread
 groups, processes and systems, and **in modes** clauses indicate
 which subcomponents and connections are active in a given mode. In
 this case, only the threads that are part of the current mode are
 in the *suspended awaiting dispatch* state â€“ responding to dispatch
 requests. All other threads are in the *suspended awaiting mode*
 state or *thread halted* state.

  A mode may also represent logical execution state within a thread.
 In this case the mode logic is embedded in the source text and may
 be represented as thread modes and mode-specific thread property
 values or mode-specific call sequences through the use of the **in
 modes** clause. Thread and subprogram internal modes effectively
 represent a set of behavioral states, whose state transition
 behavior can be specified through annex subclauses of the Behavior
 Annex notation (see Annex Document D).

(5)  System and execution platform component declarations can have
 subcomponents with **in modes** clauses. In this case, only the
 execution platform components that are part of the current mode are
 accessible to software components. For example, only the processors
 and memories that are part of the current mode can be the target of
 bindings of application components active in that mode.

(6)  For execution platform components a mode can represent an
 operational mode that is internal to the execution platform
 component. For example, a processor may execute at two execution
 speeds. The different execution speeds are reflected in
 mode-specific property values

(7)  A component type or component implementation may contain several
 declared modes. Exactly one of those modes is the *current* mode.
 Initially, the initial mode is the current mode.

(8)  A component that has modes itself can be a subcomponent of another
 component with modes. As a result, the component can be deactivated
 and activated as result of mode transitions in the enclosing
 component. On activation of a components with modes the
 Resumption\_Policy property determines whether the initial mode is
 entered or the mode from the last deactivation is resumed.

(9)  The **in modes** statement is declared as part of subcomponent
 declarations, subprogram call sequences, flow implementations, and
 property associations. It specifies the modes for which these
 declarations and property values hold. The mode identifiers refer
 to mode declarations in the modes subclause of the component
 classifier. If the **in modes** statement is not present, then the
 subcomponent, subprogram call sequence, flow implementation, or
 property association is part of all modes. If a property
 association has both mode-specific declarations and a declaration
 without an **in modes** statement, then the declaration without the
 **in modes** statement applies to those modes not covered by the
 mode-specific declarations.

(10) A component type may specify through a **requires modes**
 declaration that a subcomponent should inherit the modes of its
 containing component. In this case the **in modes** declared as
 part of a subcomponent defines a mapping of the modes of the
 containing component to the inherited modes of the subcomponent.
 The modes of both may have the same names, or they may be
 different. Multiple modes of the containing component may be mapped
 to the same subcomponent mode.

(11) The **in modes** statement declared as part of connection
 declarations specify the modes or mode transitions for which these
 connection declarations hold. The mode identifiers refer to mode
 declarations in the modes subclause of the component
 implementation. If a connection is declared to be part of a mode
 transition, then the content of the ultimate source port is
 transferred to the ultimate destination port at the actual mode
 switch time. If the **in modes** statement contains only mode
 transitions, then the connection is part of the specified mode
 transitions, but not part of any particular mode. If the **in
 modes** statement is not present, then the connection is part of
 all modes.

(12) If the **in modes** statement is declared as part of a refinement,
 the newly named modes replace the modes specified in the
 declaration being refined.

**Mode Transition**

  The modes subclause declares a state machine describing the dynamic
 mode transition behavior between modes. The states of the state
 machine represent the different modes and the transitions specify
 the event(s) that can trigger a transition to the destination mode.
 Only one mode alternative represents the current mode at any one
 time.

 The arrival of an event or event data through an event or event
 data port that is named in one of the transitions is called a mode
 transition *trigger event*. A mode transition is triggered if one
 of the ports named in a mode transition out of the state
 representing the current mode causes the trigger event. If such a
 trigger event occurs and there is no transition out of the current
 mode naming the port with the trigger event, the trigger event is
 ignored with respect to mode transitions of the receiving modal
 component.

  A mode transition may actually be performed immediately if it is
 considered an *emergency*, or it may be performed in a *planned*
 fashion after currently executing threads complete their execution
 and the dispatches of a set of critical thread are aligned (see
 Section 13.6 for more detail). This is indicated by the
 Mode\_Transition\_Response property on the mode transition with the
 default being planned.

  If several trigger events occur logically simultaneously and affect
 different mode transitions out of the current mode, the order of
 arrival for the purpose of determining the mode transition is
 implementation dependent. If an Urgency property is associated with
 each port named in mode transitions, then the mode transition with
 the highest port urgency takes precedence. If several ports have
 the same urgency then the mode transition is chosen
 non-deterministically.

(5)  Any change of the current mode has the effect of changing the
 property value in property associations with mode-specific values â€“
 as expressed by the **in modes** statement.

(6)  A thread may execute different source text sequences under
 different modes declared within a thread. This may be represented
 by different compute execution times and different entrypoints or
 call sequences for different modes. The current mode at dispatch
 time determines the source text sequence to be executed. In other
 words, a thread-internal mode represents a behavioral state, in
 which the thread completes execution of one dispatch and awaits the
 next dispatch.

(7)  The semantics of mode transitions between modes declared inside
 threads have been described in Section 5.4.5.

(8)  Mode transitions within an execution platform component occur as a
 result of external or internal events, e.g., a processor may switch
 to a different execution speed. A mode transition within a thread
 or execution platform component does not affect the set of active
 threads, processors, devices, buses, or memories, nor does it
 affect the set of active connections external to the thread or
 execution platform component.

(9)  A mode transition within a system, process, or thread group
 implementation has the effect of deactivating and activating
 threads to respond to dispatches, and changing the pattern of
 connections between components. Deactivated threads transition to
 the *suspended awaiting mode* state. Background threads that are
 not part of the new mode suspend performing their execution.
 Activated threads transition to the *suspended awaiting dispatch*
 state and start responding to dispatches. Previously suspended
 background threads that are part of the new mode resume performing
 execution once the transition into the new mode is complete.
 Threads that are part of both the old and new mode of a mode
 transition continue to respond to dispatches and perform execution.
 Ports that were connected in the old mode, may not be connected in
 the new mode and vice versa.

(10) Threads that are active in both the old and the new mode are
 dispatched in their usual manner; in the case of background
 threads, they continue in the *execute* state.

(11) At the time of the actual mode switch, any threads that were active
 in the old mode and are inactive in the new mode execute their
 Deactivate\_Entrypoint.

(12) At the time of the actual mode switch, any threads that were
 inactive in the old mode and are active in the new mode execute
 their Activate\_Entrypoint.

NOTE: Mode transitions can only be triggered by the arrival of an event
or event data on a named port or a **self** event. This means that
trigger conditions based on the content of any data cannot be expressed
in the mode transition declaration. Instead, they have to be connected
to a thread whose source text interprets the data portion to identify
the error type and then raise an appropriate event through an out event
port that triggers the appropriate mode transition. Such a thread
typically plays the role of a system health monitor that makes system
reconfiguration decisions based on the nature and frequency of detected
faults.

The default mode transition trigger conditions based on a set of
ports is a disjunction. Other conditions can be modeled through the
use of the Behavior Annex (see Annex Document D).

Processing Permissions and Requirements

 Every method for processing specifications must parse mode
transition declarations and check the legality rules defined in this
standard. However, a method of processing specifications need not
define how to build a system from a specification that contains mode
transition declarations. That is, complex behaviors that may have
multiple modes of operation may be rejected by a method of building
systems as an unsupported capability.

In an actual distributed system, exact simultaneity among multiple
events cannot be achieved. A system realization must use
synchronization protocols sufficient to ensure that the causal
ordering of event and data transfers defined by the logical temporal
semantics of this standard are satisfied by the actual system, to
the degree of assurance required by an application.

 A method of implementation is permitted to provide preservation of
queue content for aperiodic and sporadic threads on a mode switch
until the next activation. This is specified using the thread
property Active\_Thread\_Queue\_Handling\_Protocol.

 A method of implementation is permitted to support a subset of the
described protocols to handle threads that are in the performing
computation state at the time instant of actual mode switch. They
must document the chosen subset and its semantic behavior as part of
the Supported\_Active\_Thread\_Handling\_Protocol property.

(5) A method of implementation may enforce that there is a mode-specific
property value defined for each mode.

Operational System
==================

 Component type and component implementation declarations are
architecture design elements that define the structure and
connectivity of a actual system architecture. They are component
classifiers that must be instantiated to create a complete system
instance. A complete system instance that represents the containment
hierarchy of the actual system is created by instantiating a root
component classifier. This typically is a component implementation
and then recursively instantiating the subcomponents and their
subcomponents. Once instantiated, a system instance can be
completely bound, i.e., each thread is bound to a processor; each
source text, data component, and port is bound to memory; and each
connection is bound to a bus if necessary.

 A completely instantiated and bound system acts as a blueprint for a
system build. Binary images are created and configured into load
instructions according to the system instance specification in AADL.

1. .. rubric:: System Instances
  :name: system-instances

 A system instance represents the runtime architecture of a actual
system that consists of application software components and
execution platform components.

 A system instance is *completely instantiable* if the system
implementation being instantiated is completely specified and
completely resolved.

A system instance is *completely instantiated and bound* if all
threads are ultimately bound to a processor, all source text making
up process address spaces are bound to memory, connections are bound
to buses if their ultimate source and destinations are bound to
different processors, and subprogram calls are bound to remote
subprograms as necessary.

 A set of contained property associations can reflect property values
that are specific to individual instances of components, ports,
connections, provided and required access. These properties may
represent the actual binding of components, as well as results of
analysis, simulation, or actual execution of the completely
instantiated and bound system. Thus, multiple sets of contained
property associations can be associated with the same system
instance to represent different system configurations.

Consistency Rules

1. A complete system instance must not contain incompletely specified
   subcomponents, ports, and subprograms. All processes in a completely
   instantiable system must contain at least one thread.

1. The Required\_Connection property may be used to indicate that a port
   connection is required. In the case of the reserved Error, Stop,
   Abort, and Complete ports (see Section 5.4), connections are
   optional.

2. In a complete system instance, the required ports of all threads,
   devices, and processors must be the ultimate source or destination of
   semantic connections.

3. In a completely instantiable system, the subprogram calls of all
   threads must either be local calls or be bound to a remote subprogram
   whose thread is part of the same mode.

4. In a completely instantiable system, for every mode that is the
   source of mode transitions, there must be at least one mode
   transition that is the ultimate destination of a semantic connection
   whose ultimate source is part of the mode.

5. In a complete system instance, aperiodic and sporadic threads that
   are part of a given mode must have at least one connection to one of
   their **in** event ports or **in** event data ports.

6. For instantiable systems, all threads must be bindable to processors
   and all components representing source text must be bindable to
   memory.

7. The source text associated with all contained components of the
   system instance must be compliant with the specified component type,
   component implementation, and property associations.

8. In order to be considered complete, system instance must contain at
   least one thread, one processor and one memory component in its
   containment hierarchy to represent an application system that is
   executable on an execution platform, i.e., a processor with memory
   containing the application code and data.

9. If a system instance has processors of different types, then the
   execution time of threads must be specified for each processor type
   using the **in binding** statement, or a reference processor type
   must be identified through the Reference\_Processor property.

Semantics

 A system instance represents an operational actual system. That
actual system may be a stand-alone system or a system of systems. A
system instance consists of application software and execution
platform components. The component configuration, i.e., the
hierarchical structure and interconnection topology of these
components is statically known. The mode concept describes
alternative statically known component configurations. The runtime
behavior of the system allows for switching between these
alternative configurations according to a mode transition
specification.

The actual system denoted by a component implementation can be built
if the system is instantiable and if source text exists for all
components whose properties refer to source text. This source text
must be compliant with the AADL specification and the source text
language semantics. Source text is compiled and linked to generate
binary images. The binary images are loaded into memory and made
accessible to threads in virtual address spaces of processes.

 In addition, there exists a kernel address space for every
processor. This address space contains binary images of processor
software and device driver software bound to the processor.

 Execution time of threads and subprograms is specified in units of
time. If a system instance has processors of different types, then
the execution time may vary from processor type to processor type.
Execution time specific to a processor type can be specified using
the **in binding** statement in a property association.
Alternatively, the execution time can be specified with respect to a
reference processor. The reference processor is specified through
the Reference\_Processor property. This property is declared as
**inherit**, i.e., it can be declared at the system level and apply
to all threads in a system. When a thread is bound to a specific
processor type, its execution time, if not explicitly defined for
this processor, will be adjusted according to a scaling factor
between the reference processor and the target processor.

1. .. rubric:: System Binding
  :name: system-binding

 This section defines how binary images produced by compiling source
units are assigned to and loaded onto processor and memory
resources, taking into account requirements for component sharing
and the interconnect topology between processors, memories and
devices. The decisions and methods required to combine the
components of a system to produce a actual system implementation are
collectively called bindings.

Naming Rules

1. The Allowed\_Processor\_Binding property values must evaluate to a
   processor, virtual processor, or a system that contains a processor
   in its component containment hierarchy.

1. The Allowed\_Memory\_Binding property values must evaluate to a
   memory, a processor that contains memory or a system that contains a
   memory or a processor containing memory in its component containment
   hierarchy.

Legality Rules

1. The memory requirements of ports and data components are specified as
   property values of their data types or by properties on the port
   feature or data subcomponent. Those property associations can
   have binding-specific values.

Consistency Rules

1. Every mode-specific configuration of a system instance must have a
   binding of every process component to a (set of) memory component(s),
   and a binding of every thread component to a (set of) processor(s).

1.  In the case of dynamic process loading, the actual binding may
change at runtime. In the case of tightly coupled multi-processor
configurations, such as dual core processors, the actual thread
binding may change between members of an actual binding set of
processors as these processors service a common set of thread ready
queues.

2.  Multiple software components may be bound to a single memory
component.

3.  A software component may be bound to multiple memory components.

4.  A thread must be bound to a one or more processors. If it is bound
to multiple processors, the processors share a ready queue, i.e.,
the thread executes on one processor at a time.

5.  Multiple threads can be bound to a single processor.

6.  All software components for a process must be bound to memory
components that are all accessible from every processor to which any
thread contained in the process is bound. That is, every thread is
able to access every memory component into which the process
containing that thread is loaded.

7.  A shared data component must be bound to memory accessible by all
processors to which the threads sharing the data component are
bound.

8.  For all threads in a process, all processors to which those threads
are bound must have identical component types and component
implementations. That is, all threads that are contained in a given
process must all be executing on the same kind of processor, as
indicated by the processor classifier reference value of the
Allowed\_Processor\_Binding\_Class property associated with the
process. Furthermore, all those processors must be able to access
the memory to which the process is bound.

9.  The complete set of software components making up the functionality
of the processor must be bound to memory that is accessible by that
processor.

10. Each thread must be bound to a processor satisfying the
Allowed\_Processor\_Binding\_Class and Allowed\_Processor\_Binding
property values of the thread.

11. The Allowed\_Processor\_Binding property may specify a single
processor, thus specifying the exact processor binding. It may also
specify a list of processor components or system components
containing processor components, indicating that the thread is
bindable to any of those processor components.

12. Each process must be bound to a memory satisfying the
Allowed\_Memory\_Binding\_Class and Allowed\_Memory\_Binding
property values of the process. The Allowed\_Memory\_Binding
property may specify a single memory component, thus specifying the
exact memory binding. It may also specify a list of memory
components or system components containing memory components,
indicating that the process is bindable to any of those memory
components.

13. The memory requirements of the binary images and the runtime memory
requirements of threads and processes bound to a memory component
must not exceed that memoryâ€™s capacity. The execution time
requirements of all threads bound to a processor must not exceed the
schedulable cycles required to ensure that all thread timing
requirements are met. These two constraints may be checked
statically or dynamically. Runtime detection of such a memory
capacity or timing requirements violation results in an error that
the application system can choose to recover from.

Semantics

 A complete system instance is instantiated and bound by identifying
the actual binding of all threads to processors, all binary images
reflected in processes and other components to memory, and all
connections to buses if they span multiple processors. The actual
binding can be recorded for each component in the containment
hierarchy by property associations declared within the system
implementation.

The actual binding must be determined within specified binding
constraints. Binding constraints of application components to
execution platform components are expressed by the allowed binding
and allowed binding class properties for memory, processor, and bus.
In the case of an allowed binding property, the execution platform
component is identified by a sequence of â€˜.â€™ (dot) separated
subcomponent names. This sequence starts with the subcomponent
contained in the component implementation for which the property
association is declared. Or the sequence begins with the
subcomponent contained in the component implementation of the
subcomponent or system implementation for which the property
association is declared. This means that the property association
representing the binding constraint or the actual binding may have
to be declared as a component instance property association of a
component that represents a common root of the components to be
bound.

Processing Requirements and Permissions

 A method of building systems is permitted to require bindings of
selected kinds to be fixed at development time, or to be fixed at
the time of actual system construction. A method of building systems
is permitted to allow bindings of selected kinds to change
dynamically at runtime. For example, a method of building systems
may require process to memory binding and loading to be fixed during
actual system construction, and may require thread to processor
bindings to be fixed at mode changes. Other choices are possible and
permitted.

A method of building systems must check and enforce the semantics
and legality rules defined in this standard. Property associations
may impose constraints on allowed bindings. The access semantics
impose a number of constraints on allowed bindings for processes and
threads to execution platform systems, and ultimately to processors
and memories. In general, the semantic constraints depend on the
particular software and hardware architecture interconnect
topologies. In particular, for most hardware and operating system
configurations all threads contained in a process must execute on
the same processor. Such additional restrictions must be taken into
account by the method of building systems. A method of building
systems is otherwise permitted to make any partitioning and binding
choices that are consistent with the semantics and legality rules of
this standard.

NOTE: If multiple processes share a component, then the physical memory
to which the shared component is bound will appear in the virtual
address space of all those processes. This physical memory is not
necessarily addressed using either the same virtual address in different
processes or the same physical address from different processors. An
access property association may be used to specify different addresses
used to access the same component from different processors.

The AADL supports binding-specific property values. This allows
different property values to be specified for a component property
whose values are sensitive to binding decisions.

NOTE: Binding properties are declared in the system implementation that
contains in its containment hierarchy both the components to be bound
and the execution platform components that are the target of the
binding. Binding properties can also be declared separately for each
instance of such a system implementation, either as part of the system
instantiation or as part of a subcomponent declaration.

System Startup
--------------

 On system startup the system instance transitions from *system
offline* to *system starting* (see Figure 22). **Start(system)**
initiates the initialization of the execution platform components.
In the case of processors, the binary images of the kernel address
space are loaded into memory of each processor, and execution is
started to initialize the execution platform software (see Figure
9). Loading into memory may take zero time, if the memory can be
preloaded, e.g., PROM or flash memory.

 Once a processor is initialized (*Processor operational*), each
processor initiates the initialization of virtual processors bound
to the processor, if any (see Figure 9). When the virtual processors
have completed their initialization they are operational (see Figure
10).

When processors and virtual processors have entered their
operational state (**started(processor)** and
**started(vprocessor)**), the loading of the binary images of
processes bound to the specific processor or its virtual processors
into memory is initiated (see Figure 8). Process binary images are
loaded in the memory component to which the process and its
contained software components are bound. In a static process loading
scenario, all binary images must be loaded before execution of the
application system starts, i.e., thread initialization is initiated.
In a dynamic process loading scenario, binary images of all the
processes that contain a thread that is part of the current mode
must be loaded

 The maximum system initialization time can be determined as

-  max(Startup\_Deadline) of all processors and other hardware
   components

-  + max(Startup\_Deadline) of all virtual processors

-  + max(Load\_Deadline) of all processes

-  + max(Process\_Startup\_Deadline) of all processes

-  + max(Initialize\_Deadline) of all threads.

 All software components for a process must be bound to memory
components that are all accessible from every processor to which any
thread contained in the process is bound. That is, every thread is
able to access every memory component into which the binary image of
the process containing that thread is loaded.

Data components shared across processes must be bound to memory
accessible by all processors to which the processes sharing the data
component are bound.

 Thread initialization must be completed by the next hyperperiod of
the initial mode. Once all threads are initialized, threads that are
part of the initial mode enter the await dispatch state. If loaded,
threads that are not part of the initial mode enter the suspend
awaiting mode state (see Figure 5). At their first dispatch, the
initial values of connected **out** or **in out** ports are made
available to destination threads in their **in** or **in out**
ports.

 This initialization model assumes independent initialization of
threads, i.e., no ordering requirement (other than processes must be
initialized first). If there is an ordering requirement the user can
introduce an initialization mode, in which they can utilize the full
power of AADL to specify thread execution dependencies.

Normal System Operation
-----------------------

 Normal operation, i.e., the execution semantics of individual
threads and transfer of data and control according to connection and
shared access semantics, have been covered in previous sections. In
this section we focus on the coordination of such execution
semantics throughout a system instance.

 A system instance is called synchronized if all components use a
globally synchronized reference time. A system instance is called
asynchronous if different components use separate clocks with the
potential for clock drift. The clock drift in asynchronous systems
may be bounded, e.g., by resynchronizing the clocks.

In a synchronized system, periodic threads are dispatched
simultaneously with respect to a global clock. The hyperperiod of a
set of periodic threads is defined to be the least common multiple
of the periods of those threads.

 In a synchronized system, a raised event logically arrives
simultaneously at the ultimate destination of all semantic
connections whose ultimate source raised the event. In a
synchronized system, two events are considered to be raised
logically simultaneously if they occur within the granularity of the
globally synchronized reference time. If several events are
logically raised simultaneously and arrive at the same port or at
different transitions out of the current mode in the same or
different components, the order of arrival is
implementation-dependent.

 In an asynchronous system the above hold within a synchronization
domain, i.e., periodic threads are dispatched simultaneously and
events arrive logically simultaneously. A method of implementing a
system may provide coordination protocols for asynchronous system to
provide simultaneity guarantees within a certain time granularity.
Otherwise, the dispatches and event arrivals are considered
independent across synchronization domains.

1. .. rubric:: System Operation Modes
  :name: system-operation-modes

 The set of all modes specified for all components of a system
instance form a set of concurrent mode state machines, whose
composite state is called *system operation mode* (SOM). The set of
possible SOMs is the cross product of the sets of modes for each
component. That is, a SOM is a set of component modes, one mode for
each component of the system. The initial SOM is the set of initial
modes for each component.

The set of possible SOMs can be reduced by taking into account mode
combinations that are not reachable. For example, if a component
instance with modes is itself not active under certain modes of one
of its containing components, then these mode combinations can be
excluded. Similarly, of a component inherits modes from a containing
component, then only the mode combinations of the containing
component need to be considered. Finally, reachability analysis of
modes taking into account mode transition conditions may further
reduce the set of SOMs to be considered.

 The discrete variable **Mode** denotes a SOM. That is, the variable
**Mode** denotes a compound discrete state that is defined by the
mode hybrid semantic diagrams for each component instance in the
system. Note that the value of **Mode** will in general change at
various instants of time during system operation, although not in a
continuous time-varying way.

1. .. rubric:: System Operation Mode Transitions
  :name: system-operation-mode-transitions

 A SOM transition is initiated whenever a mode transition trigger
event (see also Section 12) occurs in any modal component in the
system instance. A single sent event or event data can trigger a
mode switch request in one or more components. In a synchronized
system, this trigger event occurs logically simultaneously for all
components and the resulting component mode transition requests are
treated as a single SOM transition.

 Several events may occur logically simultaneously and may originate
from different ports of the same component, e.g., through a
Send\_Output service call with multiple ports as parameter, or from
different components at the same time. If they are semantically
connected to transitions in different components that lead out of
their current mode or to different transitions out of the same mode
in one component, then events are treated as independent SOM
transition initiations.

If multiple SOM transition initiations occurs logically
simultaneously, one is chosen in an implementation-dependent manner.
If an Urgency property is associated with each port named in mode
transitions, then the mode transition with the highest port urgency
takes precedence. If several ports have the same urgency then the
mode transition is chosen non-deterministically.

 A mode transition of a thread internal mode, i.e., a mode declared
in the thread or one of its subprograms, that is triggered by the
component itself or is triggered by an event or data arriving ata
port of the thread, takes place at the next thread dispatch. For
further detail see Section 5.4.5.

 A mode transition of a processor, device, bus, or memory internal
mode, i.e., a mode declared in the component implementation, that is
triggered by the component itself or is triggered by an external
event, takes place immediately.

The next paragraphs address mode transitions that involve activation and
deactivation of threads and connections.

 If a mode transition has a Mode\_Transition\_Response property value
of Emergency, the mode\_transition\_in\_progress state is entered in
zero time and the actual SOM transition is performed immediately. In
this case all threads in the performing state that have to be
deactivated are aborted.

After an event triggering a SOM transition request has arrived, the
actual SOM transition occurs as a Planned response, if the mode
transition does not have a Mode\_Transition\_Response property value
of Emergency. In this case, execution continues under the old SOM
until the dispatches of a critical set of periodic components
(threads and devices), which are active in the old SOM, align at
their hyperperiod. At that point the mode\_transition\_in\_progress
state is entered. A component is considered critical if it has a
Synchronized\_Component property value of true. If the set of
critical components is empty, the mode\_transition\_in\_progress
state is entered immediately. This is indicated in Figure 23.

 by the guard of the function Hyper(\ **Mode**) on the transition
from the current\_system\_operation\_mode state to the
mode\_transition\_in\_progress state.

 Until the mode\_transition\_in\_progress state is entered, any mode
transition trigger event with the same or lower urgency that would
result in a SOM transition from the current SOM is ignored. A
trigger event with higher urgency supersedes the event under
consideration for determining the SOM transition at the time the
mode\_transition\_in\_progress state is entered.

(5) A runtime transition between SOMs requires a non-zero interval of
time, during which the system is said to be in transition between
two system modes of operation. While a system is in transition,
excluding the instants of time at the start and end of a transition,
all mode transition trigger events are ignored with respect to mode
transitions.

(6) The system is in a *mode transition in progress state* for a limited
amount of time. This is determined by the maximum time required to
perform all deactivations and activations of threads and connections
(see below), increased to the next multiple of the hyperperiod of a
non-zero set of critical components that continue to execute, i.e.,
periodic threads that are active in the old and in the new SOM and
have a Synchronized\_Component property value of true. This is shown
in Figure 23.

(7) by the guard of the function Hyper(\ **Mode**)\* on the transition
from the mode\_transition\_in\_progress state to the
current\_system\_operation\_mode state. After that period of time,
the component is considered to operate in the new mode and the
active threads in the new mode start to execute.

(8) At the time the mode\_transition\_in\_progress state is entered
there are several kinds of threads

-  *Continuing threads*: threads that continue to execute because they
   are active in the old mode and active in the new mode;

-  *Activated threads*: threads that are inactive in the old mode and
   are active in the new mode;

-  *Deactivated threads*: threads that are active in the old mode, not
   active in the new mode, and whose dispatches align at the
   hyperperiod;

-  *Zombie threads*: aperiodic, sporadic, timed, or hybrid threads as
   well as periodic threads that are active in the old mode and not
   active in the new mode and whose dispatches are not aligned at the
   hyperperiod, i.e., they may still be in the perform thread
   computation state (see Figure 5) and may have events or event data in
   their port queues.

  At the instant of time the mode\_transition\_in\_progress state is
 entered, connections that are part of the old SOM and not part of
 the new SOM are disabled.

 While in the mode\_transition\_in\_progress state, for all
 connections between data ports that are declared to be active in
 the current mode transition and whose source threads have completed
 execution at the time the mode\_transition\_in\_progress state is
 entered, data is transferred from the **out** data port such that
 its value becomes available at the first dispatch of the receiving
 thread.

  At the instant in time the mode\_transition\_in\_progress state is
 exited, connections that are not part of the old SOM and are part
 of the new SOM are enabled. At that time the new current SOM is
 entered and the following hold for data port connections. The data
 value of the **out** data port of the source thread is transferred
 into the **in** data port variable of the newly enabled thread,
 unless the **in** data port of the destination thread is the
 destination of a connection active in the current mode transition.

  While in the mode\_transition\_in\_progress state, all continuing
 threads continue to get dispatched and execute, but will only use
 connections that are active in both the old and the new SOM.

(5)  When the mode\_transition\_in\_progress state is entered, *thread*
 **exit(Mode)** is triggered to deactivate all threads that are part
 of the old mode and not part of the new mode, i.e., the set of
 deactivated threads. This results in the execution of deactivation
 entrypoints for those threads (see Figure 5).

(6)  When the mode\_transition\_in\_progress state is entered, *thread*
 **enter(Mode)** is triggered to activate threads that are part of
 the new mode and not part of the old mode, i.e., the set of
 activated threads. This permits those threads to execute their
 activation entrypoints (see Figure 5).

(7)  There is no requirement that all deactivation entrypoint executions
 complete before any activation entrypoint executions start. The
 maximum execution time for the deactivations and activations is the
 maximum deadline of the respective entrypoints.

(8)  Zombie threads may be stopped at actual mode switch time, they may
 be suspended, or they may complete their execution while mode
 transition is in progress. The Active\_Thread\_Handling\_Protocol
 property specifies for each such thread what action is to be taken
 at the time the mode\_transition\_in\_progress state is entered.

(9)  The default action is to stop the execution of the zombie thread
 and execute its recover entrypoint indicating an stop for
 deactivation - effectively handling them like deactivated threads.
 This permits the thread to recover to a consistent state for future
 activation, including the release of resources held by the thread.
 Upon completion of the recover entrypoint, execution the thread
 enters the suspended awaiting mode state; event and event data port
 queues of the thread are flushed by default or remain in the queue
 until the thread is activated again as specified by the
 Active\_Thread\_Queue\_Handling\_Protocol property. If the thread
 was executing a remotely called subprogram, the current dispatch
 execution of the calling thread of a call in progress or queued
 call is also aborted. In this case the recover entrypoint deadline
 is taken into account when determining the duration of the
 mode\_transition\_in\_progress state.

(10) Other actions are project-specific implementor provided action and
 may include:

-  Suspend the execution of the zombie thread for resumption the next
   time the thread is part of a new mode. This action is only safe to
   use if the thread does not hold the lock to a shared resource.

-  Complete\_one permits the thread to complete the execution of its
   current dispatch and invoke its deactivation entrypoint. Any
   remaining queued events, or event data may be flushed, or remain in
   the queue until the thread is activated again, as specified by the
   Active\_Thread\_Queue\_Handling\_Protocol property. The output is
   held and communicated according to the connections when the thread is
   reactivated. In this case the execution of the zombie thread competes
   for execution platform resources.

-  Complete\_all permits the thread to finish processing all events or
   event data in its queues at the time the actual mode switch state is
   entered. The output is held and communicated according to the
   connections when the thread is reactivated. When execution completes
   the deactivation entrypoint is executed. In this case the execution
   of the zombie thread competes for execution platform resources.

 At the next multiple of the SOM transition hyperperiod the system
instance enters current\_system\_operation\_mode state and starts
responding to new requests for SOM transition.

Figure âˆ’ System Mode Transition Semantics
 

 The synchronization scope for **enter(Mode)** consists of all
threads that are contained in the system instance that were inactive
and are about to become active. The synchronization scope for
**exit(Mode)** contains all threads that are contained in the system
instance that were active and are to become inactive. The edge
labels **enter(Mode)** and **exit(Mode)** also appear in the set of
concurrent semantic automata derived from the mode declarations in a
specification. That is, **enter(Mode)** and **exit(Mode)**
transitions for threads occur synchronously with a transition from
the current\_system\_operation\_mode state to the
mode\_transition\_in\_progress state.

The description of this time-coordinated transitioning of system
operation mode assumes a synchronous system, i.e., a single
synchronization domain. In the case of an asynchronous system,
multiple synchronization domains exist in a system. In this case,
the coordinated activation and deactivation of threads and
connections as part of a system operation mode transition must be
ensured within each synchronization domain. In the case of an
asynchronous system, coordination protocols may be supported to
coordinate system operation mode transition across synchronization
domains within bounded time.

System-wide Fault Handling, Shutdown, and Restart
-------------------------------------------------

 Thread unrecoverable errors result in transmission of event data on
the Error port of the appropriate thread, processor, or device. The
ultimate destination of this semantic connection can be a thread or
set of threads whose role is that of a system health monitor and
system configuration manager. Such threads make decisions about
appropriate fault handling actions to take. Such actions include
raising of events to trigger mode switches, e.g., to request SOM
transitions.

Runtime Services

 Several runtime services are provided to control starting and
stopping of the system, processors, virtual processors, and
processes. They may be explicitly called by application source code,
or they may be called by an AADL runtime system that is generated
from an AADL model.

Current\_System\_Mode returns a value corresponding to the active
system operation mode (SOM).

**subprogram** Current\_System\_Mode

**features**

ModeID: **out parameter** <implementor-specific>; -- ID of the mode

**end** Current\_System\_Mode;

 Set\_System\_Mode indicates the next SOM the runtime system must
switch to. System modes are assumed to have identifying numbers.

**subprogram** Set\_System\_Mode

**features**

ModeID: **in parameter** <implementor-specific>; -- ID of the SOM

**end** Set\_System\_Mode;

 The following subprograms take a process, virtual processor, or
processor ID as parameter. The ID representation is determined by
the runtime system.

Stop\_Process is called for a controlled shut-down of a process,
i.e., all of its contained threads, whether executing, awaiting a
dispatch, or not part of the current mode, are given a chance to
execute their finalize entrypoint before being halted.

 Abort\_Process is called for a shut-down of a process due to an
anomaly. All of its contained threads are terminated immediately.

 Stop\_Virtual\_Processor is called to initiate a transition to the
virtual processor stopping state at the next hyperperiod. This has
the effect of initiating Stop\_Virtual\_Processor for all virtual
processors bound to the virtual processor, and Stop\_Process for all
processes bound to the virtual processor.

(5) Abort\_Virtual\_Processor is called for a shut-down of a virtual
processor due to an anomaly. All virtual processors and processes
bound to the virtual processor are aborted.

(6) Stop\_Processor is called to initiate a transition to the processor
stopping state at the next hyperperiod. This has the effect of
initiating Stop\_Virtual\_Processor for all virtual processors bound
to the processor, and Stop\_Process for all processes bound to the
processor.

(7) Abort\_Processor is called for a shut-down of a processor due to an
anomaly. All virtual processors and processes bound to the processor
are aborted.

(8) Stop\_System is called to initiate a transition to the system
stopping state, which will initiate a Stop\_Processor for all
processors in the system.

(9) Abort\_System is called for a shut-down of the system due to an
anomaly. All processors in the system are aborted.

Processing Requirements and Permissions

  This standard does not require that source text be associated with
 a software or execution platform category. However, a method of
 implementing systems may impose this requirement as a precondition
 for constructing a actual system from a specification.

 A system instance represents the runtime architecture of an
 application system that is to be analyzed and processed. A system
 instance is identified to a tool by a component classifier
 reference to an instantiable system implementation. For example, a
 tool may allow a system classifier reference to be supplied as a
 command line parameter. Any such externally identified component
 specification must satisfy all the rules defined in this
 specification for system instances.

  A method of building systems is permitted to only support static
 process loading.

  A method of building systems is permitted to create any set of
 loadable binary images that satisfy the semantics and legality
 rules of this standard. For example, a single load image may be
 created for each processor that contains all processes and threads
 executed by that processor and all source text associated with
 devices and buses accessible by that processor. Or a separate load
 image may be created for each process to be loaded into memory to
 make up the process virtual address space, in addition to the
 kernel address space created for each processor.

(5)  A process may define a source namespace for the purpose of
 compiling source programs, define a virtual address space, and
 define a binary image for the purpose of loading. A method of
 building systems is permitted to separate these functions. For
 example, processes may be compiled and pre-linked as separate
 programs, followed by a secondary linking to combine the process
 binary images to form a load image.

(6)  A method of building systems is permitted to compile, link and load
 a process as a single source program. That is, a method of building
 systems is permitted to impose the additional requirement that all
 associated source text for all threads contained in a process form
 a legal program as defined in the applicable programming language
 standard.

(7)  If two software components that are compiled and linked within the
 same namespace have identical component types and implementations,
 or the intersection of their associated source text compilation
 units is non-empty, then this must be detected and reported.

(8)  A method of building systems is permitted to omit loading of
 processor, device driver, and bus protocol software in a processor
 kernel address space if none of the threads bound to that processor
 need to access or execute that software.

(9)  This standard supports static virtual memory management, i.e.,
 permits the construction of systems in which binary images of
 processes are loaded during system initialization, before a system
 begins operation.

(10) Also permitted are methods of dynamic virtual memory management or
 dynamic library linking after process loading has completed and
 thread execution has started. However, any method for implementing
 a system must assure that all deadline properties will be satisfied
 for each thread.

(11) An alternative implementation of the process and thread state
 transition sequences is permitted in which a process is loaded and
 initialized each time the system changes to a mode of operation in
 which any of the containing threads in that process are active.
 This process load and initialize replaces the perform thread
 activate action in the thread state transition sequence as well as
 the process load action in the process state transition sequence.
 These alternative semantics may be adopted for any designated
 subset of the processes in a system. All threads contained in a
 process must obey the same thread semantics.

Layered System Architectures
============================

 Layering of system architectures is supported in AADL in several
ways:

-  Hierarchical containment of components;

-  Layered use of threads for processing and services;

-  Layered virtual machine abstraction of the execution platform.

 The hierarchical containment of components is the result of modeling
a system as a component architecture and decomposing its
capabilities hierarchically. This is supported by the abstract
component category as well as the software components, the hardware
components, and the system components. Interaction between
components at different levels of the system hierarchy is managed
and controlled by the component features. Connections between the
components must follow the component hierarchy.

Threads and devices represent active components in a system. Threads
and devices interact with other threads and devices through
directional flow of events and data, representing a pipeline
architecture pattern. Threads also may call on services of other
threads through subprogram service calls. These thread services
often are organized into service layers in that threads of one layer
call on services of the same or lower layer, but not higher layers.
Multi-tiered e-business architectures are examples of this
architecture pattern. Threads and related components of different
service layer can be organized into separate packages and access to
packages can be restricted by convention to follow the layering
hierarchy. Packages or components such as threads can be attributed
with a Service\_Layer property that can be used by a design rule
checker to enforce such layering.

 Execution platform components virtual processor and virtual bus can
represent virtual machine abstractions. For example, a virtual
processor may represent a language runtime system such as the Ada
runtime system, which is responsible for scheduling the execution of
Ada tasks. This runtime system may be implemented on top of another
virtual processor, namely a real-time operating system. Virtual
processors and processors provide the runtime service calls
described in *Runtime Support* in Section 5.4, and Section 8.3, as
well as services declared explicitly as part of the features of a
(virtual) processor type. Similarly, a virtual bus may represent a
protocol that is implemented in terms of a lower level protocol.

 AADL can be used to represent this system layering as follows: The
implementation of an execution platform component can be described
by system components. For example, a processor that represents
hardware and an operating system can be described by an application
software system to represent the operating system and a lower level
execution platform system that includes a lower-level processor
abstraction. Similarly, the internal implementation of a device,
e.g., a digital camera, can be described as a system that consists
of image processing and transfer software as well as processors,
internal memory, and USB bus interface, and CCD sensors as devices.
A map data base may be a highly abstracted memory component type,
whose implementation consists of database software and data
components that represent the database content together with
physical disks as lower-level memory components and a processor that
acts as dedicated database server.

(5) System implementations can be associated with their respective
processor, virtual processor, memory, bus, virtual bus, and device
types and implementations through the Implemented\_As property,
which takes classifiers as its value.

(6) In the case of processors, virtual processors, and devices, these
system implementations can be used as plug-replaceable patterns for
the original platform components, when an instance model is created.
The pattern is called plug-replaceable because the system component
implementing the execution platform element implements the interface
defined by the execution platform element type.

(7) In the case of a virtual bus or bus a connection bound to a bus or
virtual bus is interpreted during model instantiation as rerouting
the connection from its source to a source feature in the system
implementation of the bus or virtual bus, and a second connection
from a predeclared destination feature to the destination of the
original connection. For example, the system implementation
realizing a virtual bus may consist of a sender thread with a
predeclared source port and a receiver thread with a predeclared
destination port. Alternatively, the connection can be mapped into
Send\_Output and Receive\_Input service calls (see *Runtime Support*
in Section 8.3) to reflect an API-based functional service
architecture.

(8) In the case of a memory component, read and write accesses to data
components that are bound to a memory component can be mapped into
read and write accesses to data components in the system
implementation of the memory abstraction, or interpreted as retrieve
and store service calls to the subprogram access features of the
system component.

Lexical Elements
================

 The text of an AADL description consists of a sequence of lexical
elements, each composed of characters. The rules of composition are
given in this section.

1. .. rubric:: Character Set
  :name: character-set

 The only characters allowed outside of comments are the
graphic\_characters and format\_effectors.

Syntax

character ::= graphic\_character \| format\_effector

\| other\_control\_character

graphic\_character ::= identifier\_letter \| digit \|
space\_character

\| special\_character

Semantics

 The character repertoire for the text of an AADL specification
consists of the collection of characters called the Basic
Multilingual Plane (BMP) of the ISO 10646 Universal Multiple-Octet
Coded Character Set, plus a set of format\_effectors and, in
comments only, a set of other\_control\_functions; the coded
representation for these characters is implementation defined (it
need not be a representation defined within ISO-10646-1).

The description of the language definition in this standard uses the
graphic symbols defined for Row 00: Basic Latin and Row 00: Latin-1
Supplement of the ISO 10646 BMP; these correspond to the graphic
symbols of ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1); no graphic symbols are used in this
standard for characters outside of Row 00 of the BMP. The actual set
of graphic symbols used by an implementation for the visual
representation of the text of an AADL specification is not
specified.

 The categories of characters are defined as follows:

*identifier\_letter *

upper\_case\_identifier\_letter \| lower\_case\_identifier\_letter

*upper\_case\_identifier\_letter *

Any character of Row 00 of ISO 10646 BMP whose name begins Latin
Capital Letter.

*lower\_case\_identifier\_letter *

Any character of Row 00 of ISO 10646 BMP whose name begins Latin
Small Letter.

*digit *

One of the characters 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.

*space\_character *

The character of ISO 10646 BMP named Space''.

*special\_character *

Any character of the ISO 10646 BMP that is not reserved for a
control function, and is not the space\_character, an
identifier\_letter, or a digit.

*format\_effector *

The control functions of ISO 6429 called character tabulation (HT),
line tabulation (VT), carriage return (CR), line feed (LF), and form
feed (FF).

*other\_control\_character *

Any control character, other than a format\_effector, that is
allowed in a comment; the set of other\_control\_functions allowed
in comments is implementation defined.

 The following names are used when referring to certain
special\_characters:

+--------------+---------------------+--------------+------------------------+
| **Symbol**   | **Name**| **Symbol**   | **Name**   |
+--------------+---------------------+--------------+------------------------+
| "| quotation mark  | :| colon  |
+--------------+---------------------+--------------+------------------------+
| #| number sign | ;| semicolon  |
+--------------+---------------------+--------------+------------------------+
| =| equals sign | (| left parenthesis   |
+--------------+---------------------+--------------+------------------------+
| )| Right parenthesis   | \_   | underline  |
+--------------+---------------------+--------------+------------------------+
| +| plus sign   | [| left square bracket|
+--------------+---------------------+--------------+------------------------+
| ,| Comma   | ]| right square bracket   |
+--------------+---------------------+--------------+------------------------+
| -| Minus   | {| left curly bracket |
+--------------+---------------------+--------------+------------------------+
| .| Dot | }| right curly bracket|
+--------------+---------------------+--------------+------------------------+

Implementation Permissions

 In a nonstandard mode, the implementation may support a different
character repertoire; in particular, the set of symbols that are
considered identifier\_letters can be extended or changed to conform
to local conventions.

NOTE: Every code position of ISO 10646 BMP that is not reserved for a
control function is defined to be a graphic\_character by this standard.
This includes all code positions other than 0000 - 001F, 007F - 009F,
and FFFE - FFFF.

Lexical Elements, Separators, and Delimiters
--------------------------------------------

Semantics

 The text of an AADL specification consists of a sequence of separate
*lexical elements*. Each lexical element is formed from a sequence
of characters, and is either a delimiter, an identifier, a reserved
word, a numeric\_literal, a character\_literal, a string\_literal,
or a comment. The meaning of an AADL specification depends only on
the particular sequences of lexical elements that form its
compilations, excluding comments.

 The text of an AADL specification is divided into lines. In general,
the representation for an end of line is implementation defined.
However, a sequence of one or more format\_effectors other than
character tabulation (HT) signifies at least one end of line.

In some cases an explicit *separator* is required to separate
adjacent lexical elements. A separator is any of a space character,
a format\_effector, or the end of a line, as follows:

-  A space character is a separator except within a comment, a
   string\_literal, or a character\_literal.

-  Character tabulation (HT) is a separator except within a comment.

-  The end of a line is always a separator.

 One or more separators are allowed between any two adjacent lexical
elements, before the first, or after the last. At least one
separator is required between an identifier, a reserved word, or a
numeric\_literal and an adjacent identifier, reserved word, or
numeric\_literal.

A *delimiter* is either one of the following special characters

**( ) [ ] { } , . : ; = \* + - **

 or one of the following *compound delimiters* each composed of two
or three adjacent special characters

**:: => +=> -> <-> .. âˆ’[ ]âˆ’> {\*\* \*\*}**

 Each of the special characters listed for single character
delimiters is a single delimiter except if that character is used as
a character of a compound delimiter, or as a character of a comment,
string\_literal, character\_literal, or numeric\_literal.

The following names are used when referring to compound delimiters:

+-----------------+----------------------------+
| **Delimiter**   | **Name**   |
+-----------------+----------------------------+
| **::**  | qualified name separator   |
+-----------------+----------------------------+
| =>  | association|
+-----------------+----------------------------+
| +=> | additive association   |
+-----------------+----------------------------+
| ->  | directional connection |
+-----------------+----------------------------+
| <-> | bidirectional connection   |
+-----------------+----------------------------+
| ..  | interval   |
+-----------------+----------------------------+
| -[  | left step bracket  |
+-----------------+----------------------------+
| ]-> | right step bracket |
+-----------------+----------------------------+
| {\*\*   | begin annex|
+-----------------+----------------------------+
| \*\*}   | end annex  |
+-----------------+----------------------------+

Processing Requirements and Permissions

 An implementation shall support lines of at least 200 characters in
length, not counting any characters used to signify the end of a
line. An implementation shall support lexical elements of at least
200 characters in length. The maximum supported line length and
lexical element length are implementation defined.

1. .. rubric:: Identifiers
  :name: identifiers

 Identifiers are used as names. Identifiers are case insensitive.

Syntax

identifier ::= identifier\_letter {[underline] letter\_or\_digit}\*

letter\_or\_digit ::= identifier\_letter \| digit

-  An identifier shall not be a reserved word.

-  For the lexical rules of identifiers, the rule of whitespace as token
   separator does not apply. In other words, identifiers do not contain
   spaces or other whitespace characters.

Legality Rules

1. An identifier must be distinct from the reserved words of the AADL.

Semantics

 All characters of an identifier are significant, including any
underline character. Identifiers differing only in the use of
corresponding upper and lower case letters are considered the same.

Processing Requirements and Permissions

 In a nonstandard mode, an implementation may support other
upper/lower case equivalence rules for identifiers, to accommodate
local conventions.

In non-standard mode, a method of implementation may accept
identifier syntax of any programming language that can be used for
software component source text.

 There are two kinds of numeric literals, real and integer. A
real\_literal is a numeric\_literal that includes a point; an
integer\_literal is a numeric\_literal without a point.

Syntax

numeric\_literal ::= integer\_literal \| real\_literal

integer\_literal ::= decimal\_integer\_literal \|
based\_integer\_literal

real\_literal ::= decimal\_real\_literal

Decimal Literals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 A decimal literal is a numeric\_literal in the conventional decimal
notation (that is, the base is ten).

Syntax

decimal\_integer\_literal ::= numeral [ positive\_exponent ]

decimal\_real\_literal ::= numeral **.** numeral [ exponent ]

numeral ::= digit {[underline] digit}\ :sup:`\*`

exponent ::= E [+] numeral \| E â€“ numeral

positive\_exponent ::= E [+] numeral

Semantics

 An underline character in a numeral does not affect its meaning. The
letter E of an exponent can be written either in lower case or in
upper case, with the same meaning.

An exponent indicates the power of ten by which the value of the
decimal literal without the exponent is to be multiplied to obtain
the value of the decimal literal with the exponent.

Examples

12 0 1E6 123\_456 *-- integer literals*

12.0 0.0 0.456 3.14159\_26 *-- real literals*

Based Literals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 A based literal is a numeric\_literal expressed in a form that
specifies the base explicitly.

Syntax

based\_integer\_literal ::= base **#** based\_numeral **#** [
positive\_exponent ]

base ::= digit [ digit ]

based\_numeral ::= extended\_digit {[underline] extended\_digit}

extended\_digit ::= digit \| A \| B \| C \| D \| E \| F \| a \| b \|
c \| d \| e \| f

Legality Rules

1. The base (the numeric value of the decimal numeral preceding the
   first #) shall be at least two and at most sixteen. The
   extended\_digits A through F represent the digits ten through
   fifteen respectively. The value of each extended\_digit of a
   based\_literal shall be less than the base.

Semantics

 The conventional meaning of based notation is assumed. An exponent
indicates the power of the base by which the value of the based
literal without the exponent is to be multiplied to obtain the value
of the based literal with the exponent. The base and the exponent,
if any, are in decimal notation.

The extended\_digits A through F can be written either in lower case
or in upper case, with the same meaning.

Examples

2#1111\_1111# 16#FF# 016#0ff# *-- integer literals of value 255*

2#1110\_0000# 16#E#E1 8#340# *-- integer literals of value 224*

String Literals
---------------

 A string\_literal is formed by a sequence of graphic characters
(possibly none) enclosed between two quotation marks used as string
brackets.

Syntax

string\_literal ::= "{string\_element}\*"

string\_element ::= "" \| non\_quotation\_mark\_graphic\_character

 A string\_element is either a pair of quotation marks (""), or a
single graphic\_character other than a quotation mark.

Semantics

 The sequence of characters of a string\_literal is formed from the
sequence of string\_elements between the bracketing quotation marks,
in the given order, with a string\_element that is "" becoming a
single quotation mark in the sequence of characters, and any other
string\_element being reproduced in the sequence.

A null string literal is a string\_literal with no string\_elements
between the quotation marks.

NOTE: An end of line cannot appear in a string\_literal.

Examples

"Message of the day:"

"" *-- a null string literal*

" " "A" """" *-- three string literals of length 1*

"Characters such as $, %, and } are allowed in string literals"

Comments
--------

 A comment starts with two adjacent hyphens and extends up to the end
of the line.

Syntax

comment ::= *--{non\_end\_of\_line\_character}\**

-  A comment may appear on any line of a program.

Semantics

 The presence or absence of comments has no influence on whether a
program is legal or illegal. Furthermore, comments do not influence
the meaning of a program; their sole purpose is the enlightenment of
the human reader.

Examples

*-- this is a comment*

**end**; *-- processing of Line is complete*

*-- a long comment may be split onto*

*-- two or more consecutive lines*

*---------------- the first two hyphens start the comment*

â€“ AADL specifications may be written in whatever typeface is desired and
available.

A. Predeclared Property Sets

Normative

 The set of predeclared property sets Deployment\_Properties,
Thread\_Properties, Timing\_Properties, Memory\_Properties,
Programming\_Properties, and Modeling\_Properties is part of every
AADL specification. It defines properties for AADL model elements
that are defined in the core of the AADL. These property sets may
not be modified by the modeler. Deployment\_Properties contains
properties related to the deployment of the embedded application on
the execution platform. Thread\_Properties contains properties that
characterize threads and their features. Timing\_Properties contains
properties related to execution timing. Memory\_Properties contains
properties related to memory as storage, data access, and device
access. Programming\_Properties contains properties for relating
AADL models to application programs. Modeling\_Properties contains
properties related to the AADL model itself.

 The property set AADL\_Project is a part of every AADL
specification. It defines property enumeration types and property
constants that can be tailored for different AADL projects and site
installations.Â These definitions allow for tailoring of the
predeclared properties through changes to these predeclared property
types and property constants.

The property types, property definitions, and property constants of
these predeclared property sets can be named with or without
property set name qualification.

NOTE: All predeclared properties and user-defined properties are
applicable to components of the category **abstract** without listing
this category in the **applies to** statement of the property
definition.

NOTE: In accordance with the naming rules for references to items
defined in the predeclared property sets, the declarations in these
property set refer to enumeration types and property constants declared
in the AADL\_Project property set without a qualifying property set
name.

Predeclared Deployment Properties
---------------------------------

 The properties of the predeclared property set named
Deployment\_Properties record binding constraints and actual
bindings of software components to hardware components, i.e., of
threads and virtual processors to virtual processors and processors,
of processes and data components to memory, and of connections to
virtual buses and buses, and of virtual buses to virtual buses,
buses, virtual processors, and processors.

| **applies** **to** (thread, thread group, process, system, virtual processor, device);  |
| |
| The Allowed\_Processor\_Binding\_Class property specifies a set of virtual processor, processor and system classifiers. These component classifiers constrain the set of candidate virtual processors and processors for binding to the subset that satisfies the component classifier. |
| |
| The value may be inherited from the containing component.   |
| |
| If this property has no associated value, then all processors specified in the Allowed\_Processor\_Binding are acceptable candidates.   |

| Allowed\_Processor\_Binding: **inherit** **list** **of** **reference** (processor, device, virtual processor, system)   |
| |
| **applies** **to** (thread, thread group, process, system, virtual processor, device);  |
| |
| The Allowed\_Processor\_Binding property specifies the set of virtual processors and processors that are available for binding. The set is specified by a list of virtual processor, processor and system component names. System names represent the processors contained in them. |
| |
| If the property is specified for a thread, the thread can be bound to any of the specified set of virtual processors or processors for execution. If the property is specified for a thread group, process, or system, then it applies to all contained threads, i.e., the contained threads inherit the property association unless overridden. If this property is specified for a device, then the thread associated with the device driver code can be bound to one of the set of processors for execution. The Allowed\_Processor\_Binding property may specify a single processor, thus specifying the exact processor binding.   |
| |
| The allowed binding may be further constrained by the processor classifier reference specified in the Allowed\_Processor\_Binding\_Class property.  |
| |
| If this property has no associated value, then all processors declared in n AADL specification are acceptable candidates.   |

| **applies** **to** (thread, thread group, process, system, virtual processor, device);  |
| |
| A thread is bound to the processor specified by the Actual\_Processor\_Binding property. The process of binding threads to processors determines the value of this property. If there is more than one processor listed, a scheduler will dynamically assign the thread to one at a time. This allows modeling of multi-core processors without explicit binding to one of the cores.   |
| |
| If a device is bound to a processor this indicates the binding of the device driver software.   |
| |
| A virtual processor may be bound to a processor. This indicates that the virtual processor executes on the processor it is bound to.|
| |
| Threads, devices, and virtual processors can be bound to virtual processors, which in turn are bound to virtual processors or processors.   |

|  |
| The Dispatch\_Protocol property specifies the dispatch behavior for a thread.|
|  |
| A method used to construct a actual system from a specification is permitted to support only a subset of the standard scheduling protocols. A method used to construct a actual system is permitted to support additional non-standard scheduling protocols. |

|  |
| **applies** **to** (thread); |
|  |
| The Dispatch\_Able property specifies whether a thread should be dispatched. Threads can be activated for dispatch in given modes, which is specified as part of the subcomponent declaration of the component using the thread. In some cases the thread itself may have modes and that mode determines whether the thread is active or idle. For example, various combinations of low level control threads may be active or idle at various points in time.   |
|  |
| Expressing this through modes in the enclosing component would lead to possibly having to model many mode combinations of subcomponents. Specification of zero compute\_execution\_time for a thread indicates that thread is dispatched and its application code decides there is nothing to do.|

| The POSIX\_Scheduling\_Policy property is used for the modeling of the scheduling protocols defined by POSIX 1003.1b. Such a property specifies the policy assign to a given thread. The policy may be either SCHED\_FIFO, SCHED\_RR or SCHED\_OTHER. In a POSIX 1003.1b architecture, the policy allows the scheduler to choose the thread to run when several threads have the same fixed priority. If a thread does not define the POSIX\_Scheduling\_Policy property, it has by default the SCHED\_FIFO policy. The policy semantics are :   |
|  |
| -  SCHED\_FIFO : this policy implements a FIFO scheduling protocol on the set of equal fixed priority : a thread stays on the processor until it has terminated or until a highest priority thread is released.  |
|  |
| -  SCHED\_RR : this policy is similar to SCHED\_FIFO except that the quantum is used. At the end of the quantum, the running thread is pre-empted from the processor and a equal priority thread has to be released. |
|  |
| -  SCHED\_OTHER : its semantic is defined by POSIX policy implementers. This policy usually implements a timing sharing scheduling protocol. |

Project-Specific Property Set
-----------------------------

 There is a set of enumeration property types and property constants
for which enumeration literals and property constant values can be
defined for different systems modeled in AADL. This set of property
types is declared in a property set named AADL\_Project. All of the
property enumeration types listed in this section must be declared
in this property set. The set of enumeration literals may vary. This
property set is a part of every AADL specification.

 The set of values for the property types in this property set are to
be provided by tool suppliers for the AADL and can be tailored by
AADL users on a project by project basis to reflect those
capabilities provided by tool suppliers that are actually being made
use of in a particular project.

NOTE: The label <project-specified> indicates that actual values are to
be supplied by the person providing a project-specific property set. The
actual values do not include the < and > symbols.

Predeclared Runtime Services 
-----------------------------

 Two sets of runtime services are predeclared. The first set declares
service subprograms that can be called by the application source
text directly. The second set declares service subprograms that are
intended to be called by an AADL runtime executive that can be
generated from an AADL model, thus is not expected to be used
directly by application component developers.

 **Application Runtime Services**

 A Send\_Output runtime service allows the source text of a thread to
explicitly cause events, event data, or data to be transmitted
through outgoing ports to receiver ports. The Send\_Output service
takes a port list parameter that specifies for which ports the
transmission is initiated. The send on all ports is considered to
occur logically simultaneously. Send\_Output is a non-blocking
service. An exception is raised if the send fails with exception
codes indicating the failing port and type of failure.

**subprogram** Send\_Output

**features**

OutputPorts: **in parameter** <implementation-dependent port list>;

-- List of ports whose output is transferred

SendException: **out event data**; -- exception if send fails to
complete

**end** Send\_Output;

NOTE: The Send\_Output runtime service replaces the Raise\_Event service
in the original AADL standard\ *. *

 A Put\_Value runtime service allows the source text of a thread to
supply a data value to a port variable. This data value will be
transmitted at the next Send\_Output call in the source text or by
the runtime system at completion time or deadline.

**subprogram** Put\_Value

**features**

Portvariable: **requires data access**; -- reference to port variable

DataValue: **in parameter**; -- value to be stored

DataSize: **in parameter**; - size in bytes (optional)

**end** Put\_Value;

 A Receive\_Input runtime service allows the source text of a thread
to explicitly request port input on its incoming ports to be frozen
and made accessible through the port variables. Any previous content
of the port variable is overwritten, i.e., any previous queue
content not processed by Next\_Value calls is discarded. The
Receive\_Input service takes a parameter that specifies for which
ports the input is frozen. Newly arriving data may be queued, but
does not affect the input that thread has access to (see Section
9.1). Receive\_Input is a non-blocking service.

**subprogram** Receive\_Input

**features**

InputPorts: **in parameter** <implementation-dependent port list>;

-- List of ports whose input is frozen

**end** Receive\_Input;

 In the case of data ports the value is made available without
requiring a Next\_Value call. The Get\_Count will return the value 1
if the value has been updated, i.e., is *fresh*. If the data is not
fresh, the value zero is returned.

In the case of event data ports each data value is retrieved from
the queue through the Next\_Value call and made available as port
variable value. Subsequent calls to Get\_Value or direct access of
the port variable will return this value until the next Next\_Value
call.

 In case of event ports and event data ports the queue is available
to the thread, i.e., Get\_Count will return the size of the queue.
If the queue size is greater than one the Dequeued\_Items property
and Dequeue\_Protocol property may specify that more than one
element is made accessible to the source text of a thread.

 A Get\_Value runtime service shall be provided that allows the
source text of a thread to access the current value of a port
variable. The service call returns the data value. Repeated calls to
Get\_Value result in the same value to be returned, unless the
current value is updated through a Receive\_Input call or a
Next\_Value call.

**subprogram** Get\_Value

**features**

Portvariable: **requires data access**; -- reference to port variable

DataValue: **out parameter**; -- value being retrieved

DataSize: **in parameter**; - size in bytes (optional)

**end** Get\_Value;

 A Get\_Count runtime service shall be provided that allows the
source text of a thread to determine whether a new data value is
available on a port variable, and in case of queued event and event
data ports, who many elements are available to the thread in the
queue. A count of zero indicates that no new data value is
available.

**subprogram** Get\_Count

**features**

Portvariable: **requires data access**; -- reference to port variable

CountValue: **out parameter** BaseTypes::Integer; -- content count of
port variable

**end** Get\_Count;

 A Next\_Value runtime service shall be provided that allows the
source text of a thread to get access to the next queued element of
a port variable as the current value. A NoValue exception is raised
if no more values are available.

**subprogram** Next\_Value

**features**

Portvariable: **requires data access**; -- reference to port variable

DataValue: **out parameter**; -- value being retrieved

DataSize: **in parameter**; -- size in bytes (optional)

NoValue: **out event port**; -- exception if no value is available

**end** Next\_Value;

 A Updated runtime service shall be provided that allows the source
text of a thread to determine whether input has been transmitted to
a port since the last Receive\_Input service call.

**subprogram** Updated

**features**

Portvariable: **in parameter** <implementation-dependent port
reference>;

-- reference to port variable

FreshFlag: **out parameter** BaseTypes::Boolean; -- true if new arrivals

**end** Updated;

 **Runtime Executive Services**

The following are subprograms may be explicitly called by
application source code, or they may be called by an AADL runtime
system that is generated from an AADL model.

 The Get\_Resource and Release\_ResourceÂ  runtime services represent
an abstract interface for functions that perform locking and
unlocking of resources according to the specified concurrency
control protocol. The method may lock multiple resources
simultaneously.

**subprogram**Â  Get\_Resource

**features**

resource: **in parameter** <implementation-specific representation of
one or more resources>;Â 

**end** Get\_Resource;

**subprogram**Â  Release\_ResourceÂ 

**features**

resource: **in parameter** <implementation-specific representation of
one or more resources>;Â 

**end** Release\_Resource;

 The Await\_DispatchÂ runtime service is called to suspend the thread
execution at completion of its dispatch execution. It is the point
at which the next dispatch resumes. The service call takes several
parameters. It takes a DispatchPort list and an optional trigger
condition function to identify the ports and the condition under
which the dispatch is triggered. If the condition function is not
present any of the ports in the list can trigger the dispatch. It
takes a DispatchedPort as out parameter to return the port(s) that
triggered the dispatch. It takes OutputPorts and InputPorts as port
lists. OutputPorts, if present, identifies the set of ports whose
sending is initiated at completion of execution, equivalent to an
implicit Send\_Output service call. InputPorts, if present,
identifies the set of ports whose content is received at the next
dispatch, equivalent to an implicit Receive\_Input service call.

**subprogramÂ ** Await\_DispatchÂ 

**features**

-- List of ports whose output is sent at completion/deadline

OutputPorts: **in parameter** <implementation-defined port list>;

-- List of ports that can trigger a dispatch

DispatchPorts: **in parameter** <implementation-defined port list>;

-- list of ports that did trigger a dispatch

DispatchedPort: **out parameter** < implementation-defined port list>;

-- optional function as dispatch guard, takes port list as parameter

DispatchConditionFunction: **requires** **subprogram access**;

-- List of ports whose input is received at dispatch

InputPorts: **in parameter** <implementation-defined port list>;

**end** Await\_Dispatch;

 A Raise\_Error runtime service shall be provided that allows a
thread to explicitly raise a thread recoverable or thread
unrecoverable error. Raise\_Error takes an error type identifier as
parameter.

**subprogram**Â  Raise\_ErrorÂ 

**features**

errorID: **in parameter** <implementation-defined error type>;

**end** Raise\_Error;

 A Get\_Error\_Code runtime service shall be provided that allows a
recover entrypoint to determine the type of error that caused the
entrypoint to be invoked.

**subprogram** Get\_Error\_Code

**features**

errorID: **out parameter** <implementation-defined error type>;

**end** Get\_Error\_Code;

 Subprograms have event ports but do not have an error port. If a
Raise\_Error is called, it is passed to the error port of the
enclosing thread. If a Raise\_Error is called by a remotely called
subprogram, the error is passed to the error port of the thread
executing the remotely called subprogram. The Raise\_Error method is
permitted to have an error identification as parameter value. This
error identification can be passed through the error port as the
data value, since the error port is defined as event data port.

A Await\_Result runtime service shall be provided that allows an
application to wait for the result of a semi-synchronous subprogram
call.

**subprogram** Await\_Result

**features**

CallID: **in parameter** <implementation-defined call ID>;

**end** Await\_Result;

 Current\_System\_Mode returns a value corresponding to the active
system operation mode (SOM).

**subprogram** Current\_System\_Mode

**features**

ModeID: **out parameter** <implementor-specific>; -- ID of the mode

**end** Current\_System\_Mode;

 Set\_System\_Mode indicates the next SOM the runtime system must
switch to. System modes are assumed to have identifying numbers.

**subprogram** Set\_System\_Mode

**features**

ModeID: **in parameter** <implementor-specific>; -- ID of the SOM

**end** Set\_System\_Mode;

 Current\_System\_Mode returns a value corresponding to the active
system operation mode (SOM).

**subprogram** Current\_System\_Mode

**features**

ModeID: **out parameter** <implementor-specific>; -- ID of the mode

**end** Current\_System\_Mode;

 Set\_System\_Mode indicates the next SOM the runtime system must
switch to. System modes are assumed to have identifying numbers.

**subprogram** Set\_System\_Mode

**features**

ModeID: **in parameter** <implementor-specific>; -- ID of the SOM

**end** Set\_System\_Mode;

 The following subprograms take a process, virtual processor, or
processor ID as parameter. The ID representation is determined by
the runtime system.

Stop\_Process is called for a controlled shut-down of a process,
i.e., all of its contained threads, whether executing, awaiting a
dispatch, or not part of the current mode, are given a chance to
execute their finalize entrypoint before being halted.

 Abort\_Process is called for a shut-down of a process due to an
anomaly. All of its contained threads are terminated immediately.

 Stop\_Virtual\_Processor is called to initiate a transition to the
virtual processor stopping state at the next hyperperiod. This has
the effect of initiating Stop\_Virtual\_Processor for all virtual
processors bound to the virtual processor, and Stop\_Process for all
processes bound to the virtual processor.

(5) Abort\_Virtual\_Processor is called for a shut-down of a virtual
processor due to an anomaly. All virtual processors and processes
bound to the virtual processor are aborted.

(6) Stop\_Processor is called to initiate a transition to the processor
stopping state at the next hyperperiod. This has the effect of
initiating Stop\_Virtual\_Processor for all virtual processors bound
to the processor, and Stop\_Process for all processes bound to the
processor.

(7) Abort\_Processor is called for a shut-down of a processor due to an
anomaly. All virtual processors and processes bound to the processor
are aborted.

(8) Stop\_System is called to initiate a transition to the system
stopping state, which will initiate a Stop\_Processor for all
processors in the system.

(9) Abort\_System is called for a shut-down of the system due to an
anomaly. All processors in the system are aborted.

   various kinds that may occur in a component. Examples are execution
   sequences of subprograms, end-to-end sequencing of data and event
   flow, the interaction between components, or a specification of mode
   transitions. Behaviors describe how various fault events cause a
   component to transition between various error states. Behaviors are
   nameable objects in specifications and have properties.

-  *Binding:* [AADL] A *binding* establishes a many-to-one
   hosted/allocated relationship between components using resources and
   those representing resources. In particular, it maps application
   components to execution platform components.

-  *Bus*: [AADL] A *bus* is a *category* of component used to model a
   communication channel, typically hardware together with communication
   protocols that can exchange control and data between memories,

   component type and has an implementation.

-  *Component Category*: [AADL] A component category is either the name
   of a kind of execution platform component (e.g., processor), a

   *processor*, *memory*, *bus*, and *device*. The composite category
   only defines the *system* component category.

-  *Component Classifier*: [AADL] A *component classifier* is a language
   element that defines one or more *components* regarded as forming a
   group by reason of the same structure and behavior. The *classifier*
   is a reusable description of the structure and behavior used to
   define one or more *components*. There are two kinds of classifiers:
   *component type* and *component implementation*. A component
   classifier belongs to a particular *component category*.

-  *Component Classifier Reference:* [AADL] A component classifier
   reference is a uniquely named reference to a component type or to a
   component type and implementation pair.

-  *Component Extension*: [AADL] A *component extension* allows a
   component classifier to be defined in terms of an existing component
   classifier through addition of features, subcomponents, property
   associations, connections, and behaviors, while inheriting the
   elements of the component being extended.

-  *Component Implementation*: [AADL] A *component implementation* is a
   *component classifier* that describes an internal structure
   (subcomponents, features, connections), properties, and behaviors of
   a component. A *component type* can have several implementations.

   classifier* that describes a componentâ€™s visible functional and
   behavioral interface. The *component type* describes the provided
   features and accessible components of an instance of the type that
   other components may use. The *component type* also specifies the
   features and components required to create each instance of itself.

-  *Configuration*: [AADL] The set of components and connections that
   are active in the current mode.

-  *Connection*: [AADL] A *connection* is a link between the *features*
   of two components over which data, events, or subprogram calls can be
   exchanged. Connections are directional.

-  *Data*: [IEEE] A representation of facts, concepts, or instructions
   in a manner suitable for communication, interpretation, or processing
   by humans or automatic means.

   the source text. This data may have shared access by multiple
   threads.

-  *Data Port*: [AADL] A *data port* is a port through which data is
   transferred in unqueued form. It represents a variable declared in
   source text.

-  *Data Subprogram:* [AADL] A subprogram that provides an interface to
   a data component.

-  *Data Type:* [IEEE] A class of data, characterized by the members of
   the class and the operations that can be applied to them.

-  *Declaration:* [AADL] A language statement that introduces a
   component classifier, component instance, feature, connection, or
   property.

-  *Delayed Connection*: [AADL] A connection between two data ports,
   where the data is transferred at the deadline of the originating
   thread. This results in deterministic communication of state data and
   receipt of data in a phase-delayed manner.

-  *Descendent*: [AADL] A *descendent* in the component extension
   hierarchy is a component type or component implementation that
   (directly or indirectly) extends the given component type or
   implementation.

-  *Deterministic*: [IEEE] Pertaining to a process, model, or variable
   whose outcome, result, or value does not depend on chance.

-  *Deterministic Communication*: [AADL] Communication of state data
   between periodic threads in predictable order.

-  *Device*: [AADL] A *device* models components that interface with an
   external environment, i.e., exhibit complex behaviors that require a
   nontrivial interface to application software systems. A device cannot
   directly store and execute binary images associated with software
   process specifications. Software components can communicate with
   devices via ports. Examples of devices are sensors and actuators that
   interface with the external physical world, or standalone systems
   such as a GPS. Devices interact with the embedded application system
   through port connections and with the computing hardware through bus
   access.

-  *Dispatch Time*: [AADL] For periodic threads: any non-negative
   integral multiple of the period following the transition out of the
   loaded process state. For sporadic and aperiodic threads: the arrival
   of an event or event data at an event or event data port of the
   thread, or the arrival of a remote subprogram call at a subprogram
   (access) feature of the thread following the transition out of the
   loaded process state.

-  *Error*: [AADL] An *error* in a component occurs when an existing
   fault causes the internal state of the component to deviate from its
   nominal or desired operation. For example, a component error may
   occur when an add instruction produces an incorrect result because a
   transistor in the adding circuitry is faulty.

-  *Event*: [Webster] An outcome or occurrence.

-  *Event Port*: [AADL] Port through which events are passed between
   components. Events may be queued at the receiving end.

-  *Event Data Port:* [AADL] Port through which data is passed between
   components, whose transfer implies the passing of an event. Event
   data may be queued at the receiving end.

-  *Exception:* [IFIP] An *exception* represents an error condition that
   changes the behavior of a component. An exception may occur for an
   erroneous or failed component when that error or failure is detected,
   either by the component itself or by another component with which it
   interfaces.

-  *Execution Platform*: [AADL] A combination of hardware and software
   that supports the execution of application software through its
   ability to schedule threads, store source text code and data, and
   perform communication modeled by connections. This combination would
   typically include runtime support (O/S or language runtime
   environment) and the specific hardware.

-  *Execution Platform Component*: [AADL] A component of the execution
   platform.

-  *Failure*: [IFIP] A *failure* in a physical component occurs when an
   error manifests itself at the component interface. A component fails
   when it does not perform its nominal function for the other parts of
   the system that depend on that component for their nominal operation.

-  *Fault*: [IFIP] A fault is defined to be an anomalous undesired
   change in thread execution behavior, possibly resulting from an
   anomalous undesired change in data being accessed by that thread or
   from violation of a compute time or deadline constraint. A *fault* in
   a physical component is a root cause that may eventually lead to a
   component error or failure. A fault is often a specific event such as
   a transistor burning out or a programmer making a coding mistake.

-  *Feature:* [AADL] A *feature* models a characteristic or a component
   that is externally visible as part of the component type. A feature
   is used to establish interaction with other components. Features
   include: ports and feature groups to support flow of data and
   control, access to data components to support coordination of access
   to shared data components, subprogram access to bind subprogram
   calls, and parameters to represent the data values that can be passed
   into and out of subprograms.

-  *Immediate Connection*: [AADL] A connection between two data ports,
   where the execution of the receiving thread is delayed until the
   sending thread completes execution and data is transferred at that
   time. This results in deterministic communication of state data and
   receipt of data in mid-frame, i.e., within the same dispatch of both
   the sending and receiving thread.

-  *Implementation*: [IEEE] The result of translating a design, i.e.,
   architecture, components, interfaces, and other characteristics of a
   system or component, into hardware components, software components,
   or both.

-  *Instance*: [AADL] An individual object of a class that is indicated
   by a component classifier.

-  *Instantiation*: [IEEE] The process of substituting specific data,
   instructions, or both into a generic program unit to make it usable
   in a computer program.

-  *Interface*: [IEEE] 1) A shared boundary across which information is
   passed; 2) A hardware or software component that connects two or more
   other components for the purpose of passing information from one to
   the other; 3) To connect two or more components for the purpose of
   passing information from one to the other; 4) To serve as a
   connecting or connected component as in (2). [UML] A named set of
   operations that characterize the behavior of an element.

-  *Memory*: [AADL] A *memory* is a category of component used to model
   randomly addressable physical storage or logical storage. A memory
   component may be contained in a platform, or may be accessible from a
   platform via a bus.

-  *Mode*: [AADL] A *mode* models an operational mode in the form of an
   alternative set of active threads and connections and alternative
   execution behavior within threads. A mode behavior models dynamic
   mode changes by declaring runtime transitions between operational
   modes as the result of events. Mode specifications can be
   hierarchical; sub-modes and concurrent reconfiguration of different
   subsystems can be specified.

-  *Model*: [UML] An abstraction of a actual system, with a certain
   purpose.

-  *Noncompliance*: [AADL] *Noncompliance* of a component with its
   specification is a kind of design fault. This may be handled by
   run-time fault-tolerance in an implemented actual system. A developer
   is permitted to classify such components as anomalous rather than
   noncompliant.

-  *Package:* [AADL] A *package* defines a namespace for component type
   and component implementation declarations and allows them to be
   logically organized into a hierarchy. Packages can control visibility
   of declarations by declaring them public or private.

-  *Port*: [AADL] *Ports* are connection points between components that
   are used for directional transfer of data, events, or both. Data
   transferred through ports is typed.

-  *Port Connection:* [AADL] *Port connections* represent directional
   transfer of data and control between data, event, and event data
   ports of components. The endpoints of such a connection are threads,
   devices, or processors.

-  *Feature Group:* [AADL] A grouping of features or feature groups.
   Outside a component a feature group is treated as a single unit.
   Inside a component the features of a feature group can be accessed
   individually. Feature groups allow collections of features to be
   connected with a single connection.

-  *Predictable*: [Webster] Determinable in advance.

-  *Private:* [AADL] Declarations contained in a package that can only
   be referenced from within the package.

-  *Process*: [IEEE] An executable unit managed by an operating system
   scheduler; [POSIX] a conceptual object with an address space, one or
   more threads of control executing within that address space, a
   collection of system resources required for execution, and possibly
   other attributes. [AADL]: A process represents a space partition in
   terms of virtual address spaces containing source text that forms
   complete programs. A process contains threads as concurrent units of
   execution scheduled to execute on processors.

-  *Processor*: [AADL] A *processor* is an abstraction of hardware and
   software that is responsible for scheduling and executing threads.
   Processors may contain memory and may access memory and devices via
   buses.

-  *Program:* [AADL] A *program* is a body of *source* text written in a
   standard programming language that can be compiled, linked and loaded
   as an executable image. A program has a self-contained namespace (no
   source names appear that are not declared within that program or are
   part of the language standard). The complete set of source files
   associated with a process must form a legal program as defined by the
   applicable programming language standard.

-  *Property*: [AADL] A *property* is a named value associated with an
   AADL component, connection, flow, or feature. Every property has a
   name and can be assigned a value of a specific type in a
   specification. There is a standard set of properties for each
   category of component, connection, flow or feature, e.g., thread
   components have a Period property that can be assigned a time value.
   Implementations, components, features, connections, and behaviors
   have properties. Non-standard property definitions may be defined and
   used in a specification, this is the primary means available to
   create non-standard extensions to the language.

-  *Property Set:* [AADL] A new set of properties and property types as
   extension to existing categories of components, features, behaviors,
   and connections.

-  *Property Type*: [AADL] The type of values that can be associated
   with a property.

-  *Property Value Association*: [AADL] A *property value association*
   is a statement in the language that associates a value with a named
   *property*. In some cases a property value may be overridden.

-  *Public:* [AADL] Declarations contained in a package that can be
   referenced from within another package or component.

-  *Qualified Name:* [AADL] A qualified name uniquely identifies the
   component classifier identifier with a package name separated by a
   double colon (::). Only the public package namespace is used to
   resolve these references.

-  *Reconfiguration:* [AADL] Transition from one mode to another
   resulting in a change from one component and connection configuration
   to another.

-  *Remote Subprogram:* [AADL] A subprogram that executes in its own
   thread and can be called remotely.

-  *Sampling Connection*: [AADL] A connection between two data ports,
   where the periodic recipient thread samples the output of another
   thread. This may result in non-deterministic communication of state
   data.

-  *Shared Component*: [AADL] A component that is directly accessible to
   two or more components.

-  *Software Component*: [AADL] A *software component* is a component
   that represents software, i.e., source text describing a program or
   procedure in an implementation language, and represents the units of
   concurrency of an application in terms of its threads and processes.

-  *Source Text*: [AADL] Refers to a body of text written in a
   conventional programming language such as Ada or C, written in a
   domain-specific modeling language such as
   MatLab\ :sup:`Â®`/Simulink:sup:`Â®`, or written in a hardware
   description language such as VHDL.

-  *Specification:* [AADL] An AADL source file that specifies, in a
   complete or legally partial manner, a set of requirements, design,
   behavior, or other characteristics of a system or component.

-  *Subcomponent:* [AADL] A component declared inside a component
   implementation that represents the application system or the
   execution platform. A subcomponent that belongs to the system
   category is also known as a *subsystem*.

-  *Subprogram:* [AADL] A *subprogram* is a category of component used
   to model source text and images that have a single entry point that
   can be called by a thread. Subprograms have no statically allocated
   variables. A data subprogram can be declared as a feature of a data
   component. A subprogram may be declared as a feature of a thread,
   thread group, process, processor or system.

-  *System*: [AADL] A *system* is an integrated composite that consists
   of one or more hardware, software, or system components. System is
   the name of a *component category*.

-  *Task*: [IEEE] 1) A sequence of instructions treated as a basic unit
   of work by the supervisory program of an operating system; 2) A
   software component that can operate in parallel with other software
   components.

-  *Thread:* [AADL] A *thread* is used to model a physical thread of
   execution. A thread communicates with other threads through ports.
   Threads can have different dispatch protocols such as periodic,
   aperiodic, sporadic, and background.

-  *Type:* [AADL] Qualities common to a number of individuals that
   distinguish them as an identifiable class. In this standard the term
   type is used to characterize three classes: component type, property
   type, data type.

A. Syntax Summary

**feature group** unique\_feature\_group\_type\_reference ) **;** ) \|

( **renames** package\_name::\ **all ;** )

NOTE: The **properties** subclause of the package is optional, or
requires an explicit empty subclause declaration. The latter is provided
to accommodate AADL modeling guidelines that require explicit
documentation of empty subclauses. An empty subclause declaration
consists of the reserved word of the subclause and a none statement (
**none ;** ).

component\_type ::=

composite\_category ::= **system**

unique\_component\_type\_reference ::=

[ package\_name **::** ] *component\_type*\ \_identifier

NOTE: The above grammar rules characterize the common syntax for all
component categories. The sections defining each of the component
categories will specify further restrictions on the syntax.

The **prototypes**, **features**, **flows**, **modes**, **annex**, and
**properties** subclauses of the component type are optional, or require
an explicit empty subclause declaration. The latter is provided to
accommodate AADL modeling guidelines that require explicit documentation
of empty subclauses. An empty subclause declaration consists of the
reserved word of the subclause and a none statement ( **none ;** ).

component categories. The sections defining each of the component
categories will specify further restrictions on the syntax.

The **prototypes**, **subcomponents**, **connections**, **calls**,
**flows**, **modes**, and **properties** subclauses of the component
implementation are optional or if used and empty, require an explicit
empty declaration. The latter is provided to accommodate AADL modeling
guidelines that require explicit documentation of empty subclauses. An
empty subclause declaration consists of the reserved word of the
subclause and a none statement ( **none ;** ).

The annex\_subclause of the component implementation is optional.

The **refines type** subclause of AADL V1 has been removed. Its role was
to allow association of implementation-specific property values to
features and flow specifications declared in the component type. The
same can be achieved by contained property associations whose **applies
to** subclause names the feature or flow specification.

AADL Core Language Meta Model Element Identifiers
-------------------------------------------------

 The following are AADL core language model elements that can be
identified in **applies to** subclauses of property definitions as
property owners, as acceptable classifiers in classifier property
values, and as referable elements in reference property values. They
correspond to classes in the AADL meta model. The indentation
partially indicates the subclass hierarchy. For example,
*classifier* and the list *subcomponent*, *feature*, etc. are
subclasses of *named element*, and *component classifier* and
*feature group type* are subclasses of *classifier*. Subclasses may
inherit from more than one class. For example, the class *abstract
classifier* is a subclass of both *abstract* and of *classifier*.
The second inheritance is not explicitly shown, but can be inferred
from the name. The AADL Meta Model Annex document defines the full
class hierarchy.

The meta model class name is determined by concatenating the
identifier names, each converted to starting in upper case and
followed by lower case letters.

A. Graphical AADL Notation

Normative

Scope
-----

 This appendix defines a set of graphical symbols for the graphical
AADL notation. To be compliant with the graphical AADL notation you
these iconic symbols must be used. These graphical symbols represent
components and relationships between components in an AADL model.
Graphical AADL diagrams are legal in accordance with the AADL core
standard if the AADL model being presented graphically is legal and
if the correct graphical symbols are used. For example, a graphical
editor is not permitted to create a connection whose source and
destination are not connected. Graphical presentations of AADL
models are permitted to show subsets of legal AADL models. For
example, property values may be entered through a property sheet or
dialog box. The figures in this appendix present different views of
an AADL model. These views are not prescriptive, but intended to
illustrate possible views and layouts.

1. .. rubric:: AADL Graphical Symbols
  :name: aadl-graphical-symbols
  :class: appendix2

 AADL graphical symbols are shown with the AADL logo placed as
decorator in the upper left corner of the symbol. This logo may be
omitted if its absence does not cause confusion with other graphical
notations.

 In this section we define the graphical symbols for component
categories, ports and port connections, shared access to data and
buses, subprograms and subprogram calls, execution platforms and
binding of application components to execution platforms. We also
define the representation for component types, component
implementations, and component instances. These symbols are provided
as a standard set to be used in toolsets implementing the graphical
AADL. If the standardized set is not fully supported a graphical
toolset then, the toolset must define its mapping with respect to
the standardized set.

**Component Categories**

 Figure 24 shows the graphical symbols of the component categories in
AADL.

|image19|

Figure âˆ’ AADL Components Graphical Symbols
  

 These graphical symbols are used to describe a system instance and
its components. The same basic symbol is used to represent component
types, component implementations, subcomponents, and component
instances of a particular category.

|image20|

Figure âˆ’ Decorators on Threads
  

 Decorators may be attached to graphical symbols. Figure 25
illustrates the decoration of threads with threads properties that
are relevant in a timing-related view, i.e., it shows whether
threads are periodic, aperiodic, sporadic, timed, hybrid, or
background. In the case of periodic, sporadic, timed, and hybrid
threads the decorator indicates the period or timeout value.

Introduction of such decorators is permitted for any AADL property
or other characteristic of model objects represented by the
graphical symbol. For example, a decorator may be used to indicate
completeness of timing specification in a component, or to mark a
Wi-Fi device. The use of decorators is optional.

**Component Classifiers**

 Figure 26 illustrates the use of the graphical component category
symbols to describe the components in terms of their type,
implementation, and the content of the implementation. Component
types are shown using the basic graphical symbol for the categories.
The extension relation of a component type in terms of another
component type is shown with a solid line and an hollow triangle
arrow head. These symbols are typically used in library views that
show the content of AADL specifications or AADL packages, i.e.,
component classifiers and their extends relationships (see Annex
A.2).

In the example of Figure 26, the system type *SecureGPSSender*
extends the system type *GPSSender*. If a component type that is an
extension of another component type is shown graphically, then both
the features that are locally declared and the features inherited
from the component type being extended may be shown graphically.

 The example shows labels for component classifiers and ports. The
display of those labels is optional and may be achieved through
hovering popup mechanisms. Labels may be placed outside a symbol,
inside a symbol, or as labels with a line attachment appropriate
with the available display real estate.

|image21|

Figure âˆ’ Component Types and Implementations


 Figure 26 also shows the representation of component
implementations; its graphical symbol is shown using the bold-lined
graphical symbol of the category. This bold-lining technique is
optional, but recommended if component implementations must be
visually distinguished from component types or subcomponents. The
relation to the component type is expressed by a dashed line with an
hollow triangle arrow head. Component implementation names are shown
with a dot (.) separated the component type identifier and
component implementation identifier.

|image22|

Figure âˆ’ Subcomponents
  

 Subcomponents are shown using the graphical symbol of the component
category as illustrated in Figure 27. The subcomponent label shows
the subcomponent name, optionally followed by the component
classifier after a colon (:). An underline may be used for the name
as necessary to visually distinguish the name from the component
classifier label. Multiplicities of components and features can be
shown as a decorator in the upper right corner of the graphical
symbol.

It is permitted to include a text box with additional information
regarding the context of the graphical view, such as the name,
category, and property values of the AADL model object that is the
root of the graphical view. Figure 28 shows the content of a system
implementation without the enclosing component symbol and with a
text box that contains information relevant to the enclosing
component. The dashed rectangle is used to indicate the boundary of
the view panel. AADL model elements may have a label. This label
consists of the name and optionally the component classifier â€“
separated by a colon (:). Figure 28 illustrates the use of labels
for a subcomponent and a port.

|image23|

Figure âˆ’ Component Implementation Content with Text Box
   

 Components may be parameterized with prototypes. Figure 29 shows how
such prototypes can be illustrated graphically. A paper symbol
represents the collection of prototypes and is attached to the right
corner. The content of graphical symbol can be the prototype
specification or the prototype bindings.

|image24|

Figure âˆ’ Components and Prototypes
  

**Abstract Features, Ports, and Connections**

 Figure 30 shows the graphical symbols for abstract features and
ports. In this figure, the text represents the graphical symbol
legend rather than text label examples in a graphical AADL model.
The features are placed anywhere on the perimeter of the component
graphical symbol. The orientation of the graphical symbol indicates
the direction of the feature.

|image25|

Figure âˆ’ Abstract Features, Ports and Connections
 

 Abstract features are represented by a solid circle, data ports by a
solid triangle, event ports by an open angle arrow, and event data
ports by a combination of both. The port direction is indicated by
the direction of the symbol tip. In the case of an abstract feature
an angle arrow is added to indicate the direction. The orientation
of the symbol must be adjusted according to the placement on the
perimeter. For example, the triangle of an incoming data port must
always be oriented such that the tip points into the component
graphical symbol.

The abstract feature and port connections are shown as a single
solid line. A legal AADL model requires connections to always be
connected to ports. In other words, a diagram showing a connection
attached to only one port is not acceptable except during the
operation of creating or modifying a connection graphically.

 Data ports may also have immediate and delayed connections. A single
solid line with a double arrow indicates an immediate connection. A
delayed connection is marked with a double line crossing the
connection line. If the direction of the connection cannot easily be
inferred from the feature symbols, then a single arrow may be added
to the connection line.

Figure âˆ’ Connections & Branch Points


 A connection connects two features. Connections can be made between
components that are the same level of the system hierarchy, i.e.,
subcomponents within the same implementation, or between a component
and its enclosing component.

If a port has multiple outgoing or incoming connections, they may
either be shown as separate lines or as a single line with lines
branching out from it (see Figure 31). The branch points may be
marked by a dot to distinguish them from crossing lines.

**
Feature Groups**

 Feature groups are represented by a half circle and a solid ball
with the ball always facing to the outside of a component symbol.
Inside a component, individual ports or feature groups of
subcomponents may be connected to the half circle of the feature
group as shown in Figure 32. The half circle and solid ball
represents a collapsed view of a feature group. Feature group
connections are shown as solid line. The direction of a feature
group connection may be indicated by an arrow.

|image26|

Figure âˆ’ Feature Groups & Connections
 

 Feature group types may be shown by using an expanded symbol for the
feature group and by attaching the feature group elements to the
enlarged half circle of the feature group symbol (see Figure 33).
Alternatively the half circle may be replaced by a vertical bar,
which can be expanded to accommodate a larger number of feature
group elements. The expanded symbol is useful for graphically
representing feature group type declarations and for detailing
connections to feature groups (see Figure 34).

Figure âˆ’ Expanded Feature Group Type Symbol
   

 Figure 34 shows a set of feature groups in a system hierarchy.
Starting from the left, one thread supplies a data port and the
other thread furnishes a feature group. This composite feature group
is routed from a process via its enclosing system to another system.
Within that system the feature group is decomposed into one data
port and a feature group (shown using an expanded feature group
symbol). That feature group is routed to a process, which decomposes
it into its constituents, a data port and an event data port.

Figure âˆ’ Feature Group Composition and Connections
  

 The expanded feature group symbol can be used to visually
distinguish between a connection that passes the whole feature group
to a subcomponent and a connection that passes a port group element
that itself is a feature group to a subcomponent by connecting the
former to the feature group half moon and the latter to the feature
group element (see Figure 34).

**
**

**Shared Access to Data and Buses**

 In AADL components may require access to other components and
provide access to components contained in them. The standard limits
such shared access to data components and buses. The same symbol is
used to represent access to bus and to data. Figure 35 illustrates
the graphical notation to represent sharing of data. Thread1
requires access to a data component and contains a data component
Data1, to which it provides access to other components. The
*provides data access* and *requires data access* features are shown
pointing in the direction of the component requiring data access.
Data access connections are shown as a single solid line. Both ends
of a data access connection must be connected. In our example the
required data access of Thread2 is resolved to the data component
Data1. Similarly, the required data access of Thread1 is resolved to
the data component Data2, which exists at the same system level as
Thread1.

Figure âˆ’ Shared Data Access
   

 Figure 36 illustrates access between processors, memory, and devices
through shared access to buses. Memory, devices, processors, and
systems can have required bus access. Processors and systems can
have provided bus access. Bus access connections are shown as a
solid line. Both ends of a data access connection must be connected.
Required bus access is resolved to a bus component the same way
required data access is resolved to a data component. Also shown in
the figure is a provided bus access symbol to indicate that the bus
is made accessible outside the system.

Figure âˆ’ Shared Bus Access
  

**Subprogram Calls and Subprogram Access**

 Figure 37 illustrates the graphical symbols for subprogram call
sequences and parameter passing. The sequence of calls is shown by a
set of subprogram graphical symbols with the call order indicated by
a single solid line with an open arrow head. The graphical display
of the call sequence order by use of the solid line with the open
arrow head is optional. If not shown, the call sequence can be
inferred from the left to right ordering of the subprogram symbol
placements.

Figure âˆ’ Subprogram Calls and Parameter Passing
   

 Figure 37 shows a subprogram call sequence with two calls f1 and f2
to the same subprogram filter. Subprogram call labels follow the
convention of subcomponent and feature labels discussed earlier. The
call sequence ordering is determined by the placement of the
subprogram graphical symbols from left to right.

Optionally, the call sequence ordering can be explicitly shown.
Subprogram parameters are shown using a solid triangle - the same
symbol as used for data ports. A parameter connection is shown as a
solid line between two parameters or between a parameter and a data
port of a thread containing the subprogram call. The direction of
parameter connections must follow the direction of the call
sequence.

|image27|

Figure âˆ’ Subprogram Access Features
   

 Figure 38 illustrates the subprogram and subprogram group access
feature symbols. The arrow direction indicates whether the feature
is provided or required and aligns with the direction of the call.
Subprogram access connections and subprogram group access
connections use a solid line.

**Modes and Mode Transitions**

 Figure 39 illustrates the graphical representation for modes.
Components and connections involved in a mode are shown in the
context of the enclosing component implementation. Individual modes
are shown as hexagons. The initial mode is shown with a bullet and a
transition to the appropriate mode. Mode transitions are shown as
simple lined arrows. The events triggering a mode transition can be
shown with dashed lines connecting the event port to the mode
transition, or by attaching the event name as a transition label
(shown in Figure 39).

Tools may show mode membership of connections and subcomponents in
the following way. Components and connections involved in a mode,
i.e., the modal configuration of a component, are shown in the
context of the enclosing component implementation. Mode1 is shown in
one color (shown in black in Figure 39) to indicate it as the
selected mode. The components, ports, and connections that are part
of the selected mode are highlighted in the same color. Other modes
and inactive components, ports, and connections are shown in a
different color (shown in gray in Figure 39). In other words, the
selection of a mode defines a subset view.

Figure 39 âˆ’ Modes and Mode Transitions
  

**Modeling of Flows**

 Figure 40 shows the graphical symbols for flow source, flow sink,
and flow path specifications and their use in a component type. Flow
path symbols are connected to two ports, while flow source and flow
sink symbols are connected to one port.

|image28|

Figure âˆ’ Flow Specifications


 Figure 41 illustrates how tools may graphically visualize a flow
implementation using the selection technique for mode modeling. A
flow implementation can be shown in black by selecting the flow of
interest as a flow specification in the text box. Subcomponent flows
and connections that are not part of the flow are shown in gray. An
editor can use this visualization both for displaying flows and for
defining flows. End-to-end flows can be visualized in a similar
manner. The text box has a compartment showing end-to-end flow
names. Selection of one results in showing the flow in black while
graying out the rest.

Figure âˆ’ Flow Implementation Selection
  

**Packages, Property Sets, and Annexes**

 The graphical symbol for packages is a folder with the tab on the
left. The graphical symbol for a property set is a folder with the
tab on the right. The graphical symbol for annex libraries is a
folder with the tab on the left and the annex name embedded in the
annex-specific brackets from the textual AADL syntax.

The content of packages may be shown in a nested fashion. Public and
private sections of packages may be shown as appropriately labeled
compartments. Alternatively, component classifiers in a package may
be labeled using the UML convention of a plus (+) for public and
minus (-) for private classifiers.

Figure âˆ’ Packages, Property Sets, and Annex Libraries
 

Implementation Suggestions
--------------------------

 This section suggests ways of graphically showing the system
structure and topology. Because of the structure of the underlying
formalisms, certain visualizations or views capture information that
is particularly useful to the user. The examples given in this
section are recommendations not requirements. A graphical toolset
may include alternative views.

**Package Library View**

 An AADL model represents a system as a set of component type and
implementation declarations. These declarations may be organized
into packages and may have *extends* relationships. This
organizational structure can be shown in a *library view* (see
Figure 43). This library view may show the content of a package as
component types and component implementations, and the *extends* and
*implements* relationship (see Figure 26).

Figure âˆ’ A Component Library View
 

 The nesting of package names may be simply reflected in the package
name label, or the packages themselves may be shown as a hierarchy
based in the name nesting.

**System Instance Hierarchy**

 Actual systems have an instance hierarchy. This system instance
hierarchy is implicitly represented in the set of component types
and component implementations with one system implementation
identified as the root of the system instance. The subcomponents of
this root system implementation represent the components making up
the system, and the subcomponents contained in the component
implementations of these subcomponents recursively identify the
nested component instances.

The system instance hierarchy may be shown as a hierarchical tree or
as graphical structures. In Figure 44, the system hierarchy is shown
in tree form with a solid line with a diamond at the container end
showing the containment relationship. In Figure 45, the system
hierarchy is shown as a nesting of the graphical symbols to reflect
the containment. Both representations are permissible.

Figure âˆ’ Tree-Structured Graphical Instance Hierarchy 
  

Figure âˆ’ Nested Graphical Instance Hierarchy


 In many cases navigational tree views for showing hierarchical
structures are combined with a second panel showing the content of
the selected item in the navigational tree. This allows the full
instance hierarchy to be shown in the navigator and the currently
selected element in a graphical layout (see Figure 46).

A. AADL Meta Model and XML Specification

Normative

This appendix is available as a separate document.

A. Unified Modeling Language (UML) Profile

Normative

The UML2 profile of AADL is defined as a subset profile of MARTE. It is
included in the OMG MARTE document.

A. Profiles and Extensions

Informative

 Profiling of the AADL standard is supported through project-specific
changes to the predeclared AADL\_Project property set and through
project-specific constraints that are checked by tools.

A project is allowed to add consistency rules to constrain the
architecture that can be processed. Such constraints must be
documented, including the motivation, rationale, implications. An
example constraint is that a subclause, such as **subcomponents**,
must be specified with **none** to indicate that no elements exist.
Another example constraint is that all communication between
processes must be through port connections. An AADL model that is
constrained through such consistency rules is still considered to be
a legal AADL model.

 The reasons for such constraints are to restrict the system to be
modeled, e.g., High integrity systems, or specific architectures
such as MILS, or to reflect inability to provide support for all
possible execution semantics in the runtime system.

 A profile may also include extensions to AADL, such as additional
properties that are defined in a property set. For example, support
for the MILS architecture may include partition-specific properties
and health monitoring specific properties.

Profiles can be turned into a standardized set of guidelines, for
example, the effort to define guidelines for modeling MILS
architectures in AADL.

A *minimal* AADL core subset is defined to support the following
restrictions:

 No modes, no user defined property sets, no runtime protection of
virtual address spaces, single processor, no virtual processor, no
virtual bus, queue depth 1, no remote subprogram calls, no sporadic,
background, hybrid, timed threads.

Data Sets
---------

 This annex is to provide support for defining sets of property
associations and allowing them to be associated with a model. A data
set is a named collection of contained property associations that
all have a common root for their **applies to** paths. Such named
data sets can be defined as elements of a DataSet annex library and
can be referenced in DataSet annex subclauses.

The purpose of this annex is to provide the ability to annotate
elements of an AADL model with data that is expressed as property
associations. For example, we can define a dataset that represents
estimated execution time of threads and subprograms, a second
dataset that represents benchmark execution time of threads and
subprogram, and a third dataset that represents measured execution
time of actual code. Different sets of information can be kept in
separate datasets, e.g., security related information may be kept
separate from timing information. Different datasets can be
associated with the same model, e.g., various combinations of
timing-related datasets and security-related datasets can be
associated with the system implementation that represents the root
of a system.

NOTE: Model-related data may already exist in a user-defined format.
In that case the data does not have to be converted into an AADL
property association representation. Instead the modeler can
associate the name of a file that contains such data through a
user-defined property.

Syntax

NOTE: The Unique\_component\_implementation\_reference and
contained\_property\_association syntax rules are those defined in the
AADL core language standard.

Naming Rules

1. The defining identifier of a dataset must be unique within the same
   annex library declaration. In other words, an AADL package can
   contain only one data set annex library and each dataset annex
   library has its own name space.

2. The dataset reference must name a dataset that is defined in a
   dataset annex library. The dataset annex library is uniquely
   identified by the AADL package it is contained in.

3. The root of the **applies to** path of the contained property
   associations is the component implementation referenced in the
   **applies to** statement of the dataset definition.

Legality Rules

1. The dataset annex subclause must be declared as one of the annex
   subclauses of a component implementation extension of the
   component implementation identified as the root in the **applies
   to** of the dataset.
